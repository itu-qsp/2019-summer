# Loop recap exercises

# Some lists to loop over
character = ['a','b','d','e','f']
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


# Create for loop, which prints all elements from character



# Create for loop, which prints all elements from character with their index


# Create a for loop which increments all elements from numbers by 1


# Create a for loop which increments all elements from numbers by their index value


# Loop over the list numbers and print all numbers less than 5


# Loop over the list numbers and print all the even numbers


# Loop over the list numbers and print all the even numbers, between 4 and 10.


# loop over characters and muplitply it with some random numer, and add it to a new list
