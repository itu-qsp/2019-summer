* Unskilled and unaware of it: why people fail to recognise their incompetence

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* This course is technical, and it's ok
  * The best strategy is to acknowledge that you have something to learn

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* If you are not failing, you are doing it wrong!

# Meta learning

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
1. Planning
  * Selection of strategies
2. Monitoring

  * Appraising and correct strategies

You may have seen Bloom's taxonomy before.
The important point is that lower levels are prerequisite for higher levels but higher levels powerfully reinforce lower levels.

## Meta learning example 1: Handwritten notes

* Your conceptual understanding increases when you take notes by hand
  * A study [on students and their note taking habits](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/)
* Cognitive processing improves when you interact physically
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}} -->
## Meta learning example 2: Avoid multitasking

* Brains are notoriously bad at multitasking
* Apparently **40%** of your time in class is spent on unrelated activities
  * Study on [affects of multitasking with laptops](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893903)
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* Take-away
  1. Exploit your tactile senses to take physical notes
  2. Have the self-discipline to shut down your laptop when we speak

# Metacognition

A [study on metacognition](https://phys.org/news/2017-10-metacognition-boosts-gen-chem-exam.html) shows that teaching students about metacognition gives better grades:

  > "The students who are successful will ask themselves—what is this question asking me to do? How does that relate
  > to what we're doing in class? Why are they giving me this question? If there's an equation, why does this equation
  > work? That's the metacognitive part.
  > If they will kick that in, they will see their grades go straight through the roof."

## Hacking your grades

* Be aware of how you think
  * How are you currently going about it? Is that the best way?
* **What** are you learning?
  * And how does that fit into the bigger picture? Why is it relevant?
* **How** are you learning?
  * Visual, auditory etc. (modalities)
  * Practical vs theoretical

# Summary

* We prepared a lot for you, and you will likely not find it easy

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* You are human: fail fast
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* This takes time. Seriously. Take. The. Time
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
* Think about how you think and learn
  * Is it smart to attend the lectures but never work on it by yourself?
  * Take notes!
  * (Hint: we won't be there to help you at the exam)
