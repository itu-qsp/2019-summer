# Inspired by the exercises from Automate the boring stuff Chapter 4.



# Create a list called animals, containing the following strings: 'cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'


# print the first element from animals


# print the animal "rat"


# print all of the animals



# What happens if we use the index 100?



# Can a list contain the following [1,2,3,"a","b","c",[1,2,3]]?


# Create a new list named animals_with_weights containing the following two list: ['dog', 'bird', 'snake', 'fish'], [10, 20, 30, 40]


# Create a new varibale called animal_names containing all of the animal names, from animals_with_weights


# Create a new varibale called animal_weights containing all of the animal weights, from animals_with_weights


# What will the following print?
# print(animal_names[-1])

# print(animal_weights[-2])

# print(animals[1:2])

# print(animals[1:4])

# print(animals[::2])

# print(animals[1::2])


# What is the lenght of animals_with_weights


# What is the lenght of animals_names


# Try to create the following list  ['dog', 'bird', 'snake', 'fish', 10, 20, 30, 40], by using animal_names and animal_weights


# create the following list ['dog', 'bird', 'snake', 'fish','dog', 'bird', 'snake', 'fish','dog', 'bird', 'snake', 'fish'], by using animal_names


# Remove "bird" from animal_names


# Remove the last item from animal_names
