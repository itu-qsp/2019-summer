    "Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word `ADJECTIVE`, `NOUN`, `ADVERB`, or `VERB` appears in the text file. For example, a text file may look like this, see file `mad_libs.txt`:\n",

    "  * Create a module `turtle_runner.py`, which will create a turtle graphics from a text file.\n",
    "    * We wrote a `turtle_runner.py` file to help you get started.\n",
    "    * **Hint**: If you didn't already do `Part D` in the workshop, now is a good time\n",
    "  * Let your program consume one argument from the command-line, which is a path to a script file.\n",
    "    - A script file here is just a text file, see for example `script1.trtl`, `script2.trtl`, and `script3.trtl`.\n",
    "    - Scripts contain only two entries per line, a _command_ and a _value_, separated by a space.\n",
    "    - The only two commands any script can contain are `Walk` and `Turn`, \n",
    "  * Let your program read such a script file line by line and let it split each line's content on a space.\n",
    "  * Assign the two resulting elements to two variables as in \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  command, value = line.split(' ')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  * Convert the value in the variable called `value` into an `int`.\n",
    "  * Write a function `def do_line(turtle, command, value):`, which lets a `turtle` object passed to the function `do_line` so what is given in\n",
    "    - For example, when the command is `Walk` the you shall call the `turtle`s `forward` method with the argument given in `value`.\n",
    "    - When the command is `Turn` the you shall call the `turtle`s `right` method with the argument given in `value`.\n",

    "  * Create a module called `turtle_geometry.py`.\n",
    "  * In it create a class called `GeometryTurtle` which is a subclass of the class `Turtle` from the `turtle` module, see below.\n",
    "  * Now, implement the methods `make_square(self, width)`, `make_rectangle(self, width, height)`, `make_triangle(self, length)`, and `make_star(self, length)` that let a turtle print the corresponding figures. All methods should not change the last position of the turle, i. e. assume that the turtle is in the correct place with the correct angle.\n",
    "    - The `make_square` should draw a square that is `width` long\n",
    "    - The `make_rectangle` should draw a rectangle that is `width` long and `height` high. \n",
    "    - The `make_triangle` should draw a triangle where all three sides are the same length, given by the `length` argument\n",
    "    - The `make_star` should draw a star with 5 points (each corner angled with 144 degrees) where the `length` parameter specifies the full diameter of the star\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In the `main` function below you see the application of methods, some of which you implemented in your class `GeometryTurtle`, such as, `make_square`, `make_rectangle`, `make_triangle`, and `make_star` and some of which are inherited from the superclass `Turtle`, such as, `penup`, `forward`, `pendown`, and `right`.\n",
