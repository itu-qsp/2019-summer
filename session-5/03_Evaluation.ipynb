    "  1. You receive a blank sheet of paper.\n",
    "    - Draw a horizontal line in the middle of it\n",
    "  2. Write up to three positive things in the upper half and up to three negative things in the lower half.\n",
    "    - All the feedback you provide is anonymous.\n",
    "  3. Vote on what you agree on what others say.\n",
    "    * The papers circulate **clockwise** to your neighbour, connecting two rows\n",
    "    * Vote on each topic you agree with by placing **one** line \n",
    "    * Once you receive your own paper again, we are done.\n",
