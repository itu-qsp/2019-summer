Subtask 1:

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyzæøå'
print(alphabet[7] + alphabet[20] + alphabet[11] + alphabet[11] + alphabet[20])

It will print hullu. It retrieves the characters at the respective index of the string.


Subtask 2:

c = 10
while c > 1:
    print(c)
    c -= 10  # c = c - 10


We enter the while loop because the value of c is 10, and 10 is larger than 1 ( (10 > 1) is True ).
We then print the value of c, which is 10.
Afterwards we decrease the value of c by 10. The value stored in the variable c is now 0,
and we will not enter the while loop again, because 0 is NOT larger than 1 ( (0 > 1) is False ).


Subtask 3:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for number in my_list:
    print(number)

It will print:
1
2
3
4
