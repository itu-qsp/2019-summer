      "There was a slump in the shipping market, and men who were otherwise\n",
      "decent citizens wailed for one hour of glorious war, when Kenyon Line\n",
      "Deferred had stood at 88 1/2, and even so poor an organization as\n",
      "Siddons Steam Packets Line had been marketable at 3 3/8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two bareheaded men came down the busy street, their hands thrust into\n",
      "their trousers pockets, their sleek, well-oiled heads bent in dejection.\n",
      "\n",
      "No word they spoke, keeping step with the stern precision of soldiers.\n",
      "Together they wheeled through the open doors of the Commercial Trust\n",
      "Building, together they left-turned into the elevator, and\n",
      "simultaneously raised their heads to examine its roof, as though in its\n",
      "panelled ceiling was concealed some Delphic oracle who would answer the\n",
      "riddle which circumstances had set them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They dropped their heads together and stood with sad eyes, regarding\n",
      "the attendant's leisurely unlatching of the gate.  They slipped forth\n",
      "and walked in single file to a suite of offices inscribed \"Pole\n",
      "Brothers, Brokers,\" and, beneath, \"The United Merchant Shippers'\n",
      "Corporation,\" and passed through a door which, in addition to this\n",
      "declaration, bore the footnote \"Private.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the file divided, one going to one side of a vast pedestal desk\n",
      "and one to the other.  Still with their hands pushed deep into their\n",
      "pockets, they sank, almost as at a word of command, each into his\n",
      "cushioned chair, and stared at one another across the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were stout young men of the middle thirties, clean-shaven and\n",
      "ruddy.  They had served their country in the late War, and had made\n",
      "many sacrifices to the common cause.  One had worn uniform and one had\n",
      "not.  Joe had occupied some mysterious office which permitted and,\n",
      "indeed, enjoined upon him the wearing of the insignia of captain, but\n",
      "had forbidden him to leave his native land.  The other had earned a\n",
      "little decoration with a very big title as a buyer of boots for Allied\n",
      "nations.  Both had subscribed largely to War Stock, and a reminder of\n",
      "their devotion to the cause of liberty was placed to their credit every\n",
      "half-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for these, war, with its horrific incidents, its late hours, its\n",
      "midnight railway journeys by trains on which sleeping berths could not\n",
      "be had for love or money, its food cards and statements of excess\n",
      "profits, was past.  The present held its tragedy so poignant as to\n",
      "overshadow that breathless terrifying moment when peace had come and\n",
      "found the firm with the sale of the Fairy Line of cargo steamers\n",
      "uncompleted, contracts unsigned, and shipping stock which had lived\n",
      "light-headedly in the airy spaces, falling deflated on the floor of the\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fairy Line was not a large line.  It was, in truth, a small line.\n",
      "It might have been purchased for two hundred thousand pounds, and\n",
      "nearly was.  To-day it might be acquired for one hundred and fifty\n",
      "thousand pounds, and yet it wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Joe,\" said the senior Mr. Pole, in a voice that came from his\n",
      "varnished boots, \"we've got to do something with Fairies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curse this War!\" said Joe in cold-blooded even tones.  \"Curse the\n",
      "Kaiser!  A weak-kneed devil who might at least have stuck to it for\n",
      "another month!  Curse him for making America build ships, curse him\n",
      "for----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Joe,\" said the stout young man on the other side of the table, shaking\n",
      "his head sadly, \"it is no use cursing, Joe.  We knew that they were\n",
      "building ships, but the business looked good to me.  If Turkey hadn't\n",
      "turned up her toes and released all that shipping----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curse Turkey!\" said the other, with great calmness.  \"Curse the Sultan\n",
      "and Enver and Taalat, curse Bulgaria and Ferdinand----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put in one for the Bolsheviks, Joe,\" said his brother urgently, \"and I\n",
      "reckon that gets the lot in trouble.  Don't start on Austria, or we'll\n",
      "find ourselves cursing the Jugo-Slavs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed deeply, pursed his lips, and looked at his writing-pad\n",
      "intently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe and Fred Pole had many faults, which they freely admitted, such as\n",
      "their generosity, their reckless kindness of heart, their willingness\n",
      "to do their worst enemies a good turn, and the like.  They had others\n",
      "which they never admitted, but which were none the less patent to their\n",
      "prejudiced contemporaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they had virtues which were admirable.  They were, for example,\n",
      "absolutely loyal to one another, and were constant in their mutual\n",
      "admiration and help.  If Joe made a bad deal, Fred never rested until\n",
      "he had balanced things against the beneficiary.  If Fred in a weak\n",
      "moment paid a higher price to the vendor of a property than he, as\n",
      "promoter, could afford, it was Joe who took the smug vendor out to\n",
      "dinner and, by persuasion, argument, and the frank expression of his\n",
      "liking for the unfortunate man, tore away a portion of his ill-gotten\n",
      "gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose,\" said Joe, concluding his minatory exercises, and reaching\n",
      "for a cigar from the silver box which stood on the table midway between\n",
      "the two, \"I suppose we couldn't hold Billing to his contract.  Have you\n",
      "seen Cole about it, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other nodded slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cole says that there is no contract.  Billing offered to buy the\n",
      "ships, and meant to buy them, undoubtedly; but Cole says that if you\n",
      "took Billing into court, the judge would chuck his pen in your eye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would he now?\" said Joe, one of whose faults was that he took things\n",
      "literally.  \"But perhaps if you took Billing out to dinner, Fred----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a vegetarian, Joe\"--he reached in his turn for a cigar, snipped\n",
      "the end and lit it--\"and he's deaf.  No, we've got to find a sucker,\n",
      "Joe.  I can sell the _Fairy May_ and the _Fairy Belle_: they're little\n",
      "boats, and are worth money in the open market.  I can sell the wharfage\n",
      "and offices and the goodwill----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the goodwill worth, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About fivepence net,\" said the gloomy Fred.  \"I can sell all these,\n",
      "but it is the _Fairy Mary_ and the _Fairy Tilda_ that's breaking my\n",
      "heart.  And yet, Joe, there ain't two ships of their tonnage to be\n",
      "bought on the market.  If you wanted two ships of the same size and\n",
      "weight, you couldn't buy 'em for a million--no, you couldn't.  I guess\n",
      "they must be bad ships, Joe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe had already guessed that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I offered 'em to Saddler, of the White Anchor,\" Fred went on, \"and he\n",
      "said that if he ever started collecting curios he'd remember me.  Then\n",
      "I tried to sell 'em to the Coastal Cargo Line--the very ships for the\n",
      "Newcastle and Thames river trade--and he said he couldn't think of it\n",
      "now that the submarine season was over.  Then I offered 'em to young\n",
      "Topping, who thinks of running a line to the West Coast, but he said\n",
      "that he didn't believe in Fairies or Santa Claus or any of that stuff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who named 'em _Fairy Mary_ and _Fairy Tilda_?\" asked Joe curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let's speak ill of the dead,\" begged Fred; \"the man who had 'em\n",
      "built is no longer with us, Joe.  They say that joy doesn't kill, but\n",
      "that's a lie, Joe.  He died two days after we took 'em over, and left\n",
      "all his money--all our money--to a nephew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that,\" said Joe, sitting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know it myself till the other day, when I took the deed of\n",
      "sale down to Cole to see if there wasn't a flaw in it somewhere.  I've\n",
      "wired him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who--Cole?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, the young nephew.  If we could only----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not complete his sentence, but there was a common emotion and\n",
      "understanding in the two pairs of eyes that met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is he--anybody?\" asked Joe vaguely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred broke off the ash of his cigar and nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anybody worth half a million is somebody, Joe,\" he said seriously.\n",
      "\"This young fellow was in the Army.  He's out of it now, running a\n",
      "business in the City--'Schemes, Ltd.,' he calls it.  Lots of people\n",
      "know him--shipping people on the Coast.  He's got a horrible nickname.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Fred, in tones sufficiently sepulchral to be appropriate,\n",
      "\"and, Joe, he's one of those bones I want to pick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another office in that great and sorrowful City.  It was\n",
      "perhaps less of an office than a boudoir, for it had been furnished on\n",
      "the higher plan by a celebrated firm of furnishers and decorators,\n",
      "whose advertisements in the more exclusive publications consisted of a\n",
      "set of royal arms, a photograph of a Queen Anne chair, and the bold\n",
      "surname of the firm.  It was furnished with such exquisite taste that\n",
      "you could neither blame nor praise the disposition of a couch or the\n",

      "\n",
      "The oxydized silver grate, the Persian carpets, the rosewood desk, with\n",

      "Mr. Tibbetts frowned at the letter and struck a bell with unnecessary\n",

      "breeches and green zouave jacket.  On his head was a dull red tarbosh,\n",
      "on his feet scarlet slippers, and about his waist a sash of Oriental\n",
      "audacity.  His face, large and placid, was black, and, for all his\n",
      "suggestiveness of the brilliant East, he was undoubtedly negroid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costume was one of Mr. Tibbetts's schemes.  It was faithfully\n",
      "copied from one worn by a gentleman of colour who serves the Turkish\n",
      "coffee at the Wistaria Restaurant.  It may be said that there was no\n",
      "special reason why an ordinary business man should possess a bodyguard\n",
      "at all, and less reason why he should affect one who had the appearance\n",
      "of a burlesque Othello, but Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, though a business\n",
      "man, was not ordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones\"--for such a name he bore without protest in the limited circles\n",
      "of his friendship--looked up severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ali,\" he demanded, \"have you posted the ledger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Ali, with a profound obeisance, \"the article was too\n",
      "copious for insertion in aperture of collection box, so it was\n",
      "transferred to the female lady behind postal department counter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones leapt up, staring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness gracious, Heavens alive, you silly old ass--you--you haven't\n",
      "posted it--in the post?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Ali reproachfully, \"you instructed posting volume in exact\n",

      "and safely delivered it to posting authority.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's no use--no use, Ali,\" he said sadly, \"my poor uncivilized savage,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm expecting----\" he began, when a silvery bell tinkled.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was silvery because the bell was of silver.  Bones looked up, pulled\n",

      "took up a long quill pen with a vivid purple feather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Show them in,\" he said gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Them\" was one well-dressed young man in a shiny silk hat, who, when\n",

      "his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Mr. Pole--Mr. Fred Pole.\"  Bones read the visitor's card with the\n",

      "Pole.  I shall not keep you a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been waiting all the morning for Mr. Pole.  He had been weaving\n",
      "dreams from the letter-heading above Mr. Pole's letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ships ... ships ... house-flags ... brass-buttoned owners....\n",
      "\n",
      "He waved Mr. Fred to a chair and wrote furiously.  This frantic\n",
      "pressure of work was a phenomenon which invariably coincided with the\n",
      "arrival of a visitor.  It was, I think, partly due to nervousness and\n",
      "partly to his dislike of strangers.  Presently he finished, blotted the\n",
      "paper, stuck it in an envelope, addressed it, and placed it in his\n",
      "drawer.  Then he took up the card.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pole?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pole,\" repeated that gentleman.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Fred Pole,\" admitted the other soberly.\n",
      "\n",

      "believe his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have a letter from you somewhere,\" he said, searching the desk.\n",
      "\"Ah, here it is!\"  (It was, in fact, the only document on the table.)\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, to be sure.  I'm very glad to meet you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose, solemnly shook hands, sat down again and coughed.  Then he\n",
      "took up the ivory paper-knife to chew, coughed again as he detected the\n",
      "lapse, and put it down with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I'd like to come along and see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred\n",
      "in his gentle voice; \"we are so to speak, associated in business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" said Bones.  \"In-deed?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Fred went on, with a sad smile, \"your lamented\n",
      "uncle, before he went out of business, sold us his ships.  He died a\n",
      "month later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed and Bones sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your uncle was a great man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"one of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Bones, shaking his head mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never met his uncle and had seldom heard of him.  Saul Tibbetts\n",
      "was reputedly a miser, and his language was of such violence that the\n",
      "infant Augustus was invariably hurried to the nursery on such rare\n",
      "occasions as old Saul paid a family visit.  His inheritance had come to\n",
      "Bones as in a dream, from the unreality of which he had not yet\n",
      "awakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must confess, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, \"that I have often had\n",
      "qualms of conscience about your uncle, and I have been on the point of\n",
      "coming round to see you several times.  This morning I said to my\n",
      "brother, 'Joe,' I said, 'I'm going round to see Tibbetts.'  Forgive the\n",
      "familiarity, but we talk of firms like the Rothschilds and the Morgans\n",
      "without any formality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally, naturally, naturally,\" murmured Bones gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said: 'I'll go and see Tibbetts and get it off my chest.  If he\n",
      "wants those ships back at the price we paid for them, or even less, he\n",
      "shall have them.'  'Fred,' he said, 'you're too sensitive for\n",
      "business.'  'Joe,' I said, 'my conscience works even in business\n",
      "hours.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A light dawned on Bones and he brightened visibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes, my dear old Pole,\" he said almost cheerily, \"I understand.\n",
      "You diddled my dear old uncle--bless his heart--out of money, and you\n",
      "want to pay it back.  Fred\"--Bones rose and extended his knuckly\n",
      "hand--\"you're a jolly old sportsman, and you can put it there!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What I was going to say----\" began Fred seriously agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a word.  We'll have a bottle on this.  What will you\n",
      "have--ginger-beer or cider?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred suppressed a shudder with difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait, wait, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he begged; \"I think I ought to explain.  We\n",
      "did not, of course, knowingly rob your uncle----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, naturally,\" said Bones, with a facial contortion which passed\n",
      "for a wink.  \"Certainly not.  We business men never rob anybody.  Ali,\n",
      "bring the drinks!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We did not consciously rob him,\" continued Mr. Fred desperately, \"but\n",
      "what we did do---- ah, this is my confession!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You borrowed a bit and didn't pay it back.  Ah, naughty!\" said Bones.\n",
      "\"Out with the corkscrew, Ali.  What shall it be--a cream soda or\n",
      "non-alcoholic ale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred looked long and earnestly at the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, and suddenly grasped the hand of Bones, \"I\n",
      "hope we are going to be friends.  I like you.  That's my peculiarity--I\n",
      "like people or I dislike them.  Now that I've told you that we bought\n",
      "two ships from your uncle for one hundred and forty thousand pounds\n",
      "when we knew--yes, positively knew--they were worth at least twenty\n",
      "thousand pounds more--now I've told you this, I feel happier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worth twenty thousand pounds more?\" said Bones thoughtfully.\n",
      "Providence was working overtime for him, he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of anybody's money,\" said Fred stoutly.  \"I don't care where you go,\n",
      "my dear chap.  Ask Cole--he's the biggest shipping lawyer in this\n",
      "city--ask my brother, who, I suppose, is the greatest shipping\n",
      "authority in the world, or--what's the use of asking 'em?--ask\n",
      "yourself.  If you're not Saul Tibbetts all over again, if you haven't\n",
      "the instinct and the eye and the brain of a shipowner--why, I'm a\n",
      "Dutchman!  That's what I am--a Dutchman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up his hat and his lips were pressed tight--a gesture and a\n",
      "grimace which stood for grim conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are they worth to-day?\" asked Bones, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are they worth to-day?\"  Mr. Fred frowned heavily at the ceiling.\n",
      "\"Now, what are they worth to-day?  I forget how much I've spent on\n",
      "'em--they're in dock now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones tightened _his_ lips, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're in dock now?\" he said.  He scratched his nose.  \"Dear old Fred\n",
      "Pole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul.  By Jove that's not bad!\n",
      "'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred had noticed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get\n",
      "about.  How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for\n",
      "shippin'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred Pole did not know that Bones was going in for shipping, but he\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are few things that happen in the City that I _don't_ know,\" he\n",
      "admitted modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Tibbetts Line,\" said Bones firmly, \"will fly a house-flag of\n",
      "purple and green diagonally--that is, from corner to corner.  There\n",
      "will be a yellow anchor in a blue wreath in one corner and a capital T\n",
      "in a red wreath in the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Original, distinctly original,\" said Fred in wondering admiration.\n",
      "\"Wherever did you get that idea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I get ideas,\" confessed Bones, blushing, \"some times in the night,\n",
      "sometimes in the day.  The fleet\"--Bones liked the sound of the word\n",
      "and repeated it--\"the fleet will consist of the _Augustus_, the\n",
      "_Sanders_--a dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead--the\n",
      "_Patricia_--another dear old friend of mine living at Hindhead, too--in\n",
      "fact, in the same house.  To tell you the truth, dear old Fred Pole,\n",
      "she's married to the other ship.  And there'll be the _Hamilton_,\n",
      "another precious old soul, a very, very, very, very dear friend of mine\n",
      "who's comin' home shortly----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what shall we say, Mr. Tibbetts?\" said Fred, who had an early\n",
      "luncheon appointment.  \"Would you care to buy the two boats at the same\n",
      "price we gave your uncle for them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones rang his bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a business man, dear old Fred,\" said he soberly.  \"There's no time\n",
      "like the present, and I'll fix the matter--_now!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said \"now\" with a ferociousness which was intended to emphasize his\n",
      "hard and inflexible business character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred came into the private office of Pole & Pole after lunch that day,\n",
      "and there was in his face a great light and a peace which was almost\n",
      "beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "But never beamed the face of Fred so radiantly as the countenance of\n",
      "the waiting Joe.  He lay back in his chair, his cigar pointing to the\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Fred?\"--there was an anthem in his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, Joe.\"  Fred hung up his unnecessary umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've sold the _Fairies_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe said it and Fred said it.  They said it together.  There was the\n",
      "same lilt of triumph in each voice, and both smiles vanished at the\n",
      "identical instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You've_ sold the _Fairies_!\" they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They might have been rehearsing this scene for months, so perfect was\n",
      "the chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a bit, Joe,\" said Fred; \"let's get the hang of this.  I\n",
      "understand that you left the matter to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did; but, Fred, I was so keen on the idea I had that I had to nip in\n",
      "before you.  Of course, I didn't go to him as Pole & Pole----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To him?  What him?\" asked Fred, breathing hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To What's-his-name--Bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred took his blue silk handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on, Joe,\" he said sadly\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I got him just before he went out to lunch.  I sent up the United\n",
      "Merchant Shippers' card--it's our company, anyway.  Not a word about\n",
      "Pole & Pole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And, my boy,\"--this was evidently Joe's greatest achievement, for he\n",
      "described the fact with gusto--\"not a word about the names of the\n",
      "ships.  I just sold him two steamers, so and so tonnage, so and so\n",
      "classification----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For how much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred was mildly curious.  It was the curiosity which led a certain\n",
      "political prisoner to feel the edge of the axe before it beheaded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A hundred and twenty thousand!\" cried Joe joyously.  \"He's starting a\n",
      "fleet, he says.  He's calling it the Tibbetts Line, and bought a couple\n",
      "of ships only this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred examined the ceiling carefully before he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Joe,\" he said, \"was it a firm deal?  Did you put pen to paper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You-bet-your-dear-sweet-life,\" said Joe, scornful at the suggestion\n",
      "that he had omitted such an indispensable part of the negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So did I, Joe,\" said Fred.  \"Those two ships he bought were the two\n",
      "_Fairies_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Joe uneasily, after a while, \"we can get a couple of\n",
      "ships----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where, Joe?  You admitted yesterday there weren't two boats in the\n",
      "world on the market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another long silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did it for the best, Fred.\"\n",

      "Fred nodded\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something must be done.  We can't sell a man what we haven't got.\n",

      "matter out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe nodded and rose solemnly.  He took down his umbrella from the peg\n",
      "and his shiny silk hat from another peg, and tiptoed from the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "From three o'clock to four Mr. Fred Pole sat immersed in thought, and\n",
      "at last, with a big, heavy sigh, he unlocked his safe, took out his\n",

      "Her second husband had begun life at the bottom of the ladder as a\n",
      "three-card trickster, and by strict attention to business and the\n",
      "exercise of his natural genius, had attained to the proprietorship of a\n",
      "bucket-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Staleyborn was Miss Clara Smith, she had been housekeeper to\n",
      "Professor Whitland, a biologist who discovered her indispensability,\n",
      "and was only vaguely aware of the social gulf which yawned between the\n",
      "youngest son of the late Lord Bortledyne and the only daughter of\n",
      "Albert Edward Smith, mechanic.  To the Professor she was Miss _H.\n",
      "Sapiens_--an agreeable, featherless plantigrade biped of the genus\n",
      "_Homo_.  She was also thoroughly domesticated and cooked like an angel,\n",
      "a nice woman who apparently never knew that her husband had a Christian\n",
      "name, for she called him \"Mr. Whitland\" to the day of his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strain and embarrassment of the new relationship with her master\n",
      "were intensified by the arrival of a daughter, and doubled when that\n",
      "daughter came to a knowledgeable age.  Marguerite Whitland had the\n",
      "inherent culture of her father and the grace and delicate beauty which\n",
      "had ever distinguished the women of the house of Bortledyne.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Professor died, Mrs. Whitland mourned him in all sincerity.\n",
      "She was also relieved.  One-half of the burden which lay upon her had\n",
      "been lifted; the second half was wrestling with the binomial theorem at\n",
      "Cheltenham College.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been a widow twelve months when she met Mr. Cresta Morris, and,\n",
      "if the truth be told, Mr. Cresta Morris more fulfilled her conception\n",
      "as to what a gentleman should look like than had the Professor.  Mr.\n",
      "Cresta Morris wore white collars and beautiful ties, had a large gold\n",
      "watch-chain over what the French call poetically a _gilet de fantasie_,\n",
      "but which he, in his own homely fashion, described as a \"fancy weskit.\"\n",
      "He smoked large cigars, was bluff and hearty, spoke to the widow--he\n",
      "was staying at Harrogate at the time in a hydropathic establishment--in\n",
      "a language which she could understand.  Dimly she began to realize that\n",
      "the Professor had hardly spoken to her at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cresta Morris was one of those individuals who employed a\n",
      "vocabulary of a thousand words, with all of which Mrs. Whitland was\n",
      "well acquainted; he was also a man of means and possessions, he\n",
      "explained to her.  She, giving confidence for confidence, told of the\n",
      "house at Cambridge, the furniture, the library, the annuity of three\n",
      "hundred pounds, earmarked for his daughter's education, but mistakenly\n",
      "left to his wife for that purpose, also the four thousand three hundred\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a nice house--in many ways nicer than the rambling old building\n",
      "in Cambridge, from Mrs. Morris's point of view.  And she was happy in a\n",
      "tolerable, comfortable kind of fashion, and though she was wholly\n",
      "ignorant as to the method by which her husband made his livelihood, she\n",
      "managed to get along very well without enlightenment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marguerite was brought back from Cheltenham to grace the new\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Morris and his two guests sat before a roaring fire in the\n",

      "mind,\" which means that she could never keep a servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of crashing plates had come to the dining-room and\n",
      "interrupted Mr. Morris at a most important point of his narrative.  He\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's the girl,\" he said; \"she's going to be a handful.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Married?\" scoffed Mr. Morris.  \"Not likely!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He puffed at his cigar thoughtfully for a moment, then:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She wouldn't come in to dinner--did you notice that?  We are not good\n",
      "enough for her.  She's fly!  Fly ain't the word for it.  We always find\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Send her back to school,\" said the third guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of fifty-five, broad-shouldered, clean-shaven, who had\n",
      "literally played many parts, for he had been acting in a touring\n",

      "unknown to the Criminal Investigation Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She might have been useful,\" Mr. Morris went on regretfully, \"very\n",
      "useful indeed.  She is as pretty as a picture, I'll give her that due.\n",
      "Now, suppose she----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Webber shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my way or no way,\" he said decidedly.  \"I've been a month\n",
      "studying this fellow, and I tell you I know him inside out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been to see him?\" asked the second man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I a fool?\" replied the other roughly.  \"Of course I have not been\n",
      "to see him.  But there are ways of finding out, aren't there?  He is\n",
      "not the kind of lad that you can work with a woman, not if she's as\n",
      "pretty as paint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do they call him?\" asked Morris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Webber, with a little grin.  \"At least, he has letters\n",
      "which start 'Dear Bones,' so I suppose that's his nickname.  But he's\n",
      "got all the money in the world.  He is full of silly ass schemes, and\n",
      "he's romantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that to do with it?\" asked Job Martin, and Webber turned with a\n",
      "despairing shrug to Morris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For a man who is supposed to have brains----\" he said, but Morris\n",
      "stopped him with a gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see the idea--that's enough.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because she's----\"  He hesitated.  \"I don't know what she knows about\n",
      "me.  I can guess what she guesses.  I'd like to get her into something\n",
      "like this, to--to----\"  He was at a loss for a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Compromise?\" suggested the more erudite Webber.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the word.  I'd like to have her like that!\"  He put his thumb\n",
      "down on the table in an expressive gesture.\n",

      "\n",
      "The houses in Oakleigh Grove were built in a hurry, and at best were\n",
      "not particularly sound-proof.  She stood fully a quarter of an hour\n",
      "whilst the three men talked in low tones, and any doubts she might have\n",
      "had as to the nature of her step-father's business were dispelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again there began within her the old fight between her loyalty to her\n",
      "mother and loyalty to herself and her own ideals.  She had lived\n",
      "through purgatory these past twelve months, and again and again she had\n",
      "resolved to end it all, only to be held by pity for the helpless woman\n",
      "she would be deserting.  She told herself a hundred times that her\n",
      "mother was satisfied in her placid way with the life she was living,\n",
      "and that her departure would be rather a relief than a cause for\n",
      "uneasiness.  Now she hesitated no longer, and went back to the kitchen,\n",
      "took off the apron she was wearing, passed along the side-passage, up\n",
      "the stairs to her room, and began to pack her little bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother was facing stark ruin.  This man had drawn into his hands\n",
      "every penny she possessed, and was utilizing it for the furtherance of\n",
      "his own nefarious business.  She had an idea--vague as yet, but later\n",
      "taking definite shape--that if she might not save her mother from the\n",
      "wreck which was inevitable, she might at least save something of her\n",
      "little fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had \"nosed around\" to such purpose that she had discovered her\n",
      "step-father was a man who for years had evaded the grip of an\n",
      "exasperated constabulary.  Some day he would fall, and in his fall\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Cresta Morris absorbed in the elaboration of the great plan, was\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Wait a minute,\" he said.  \"I told that girl to bring in the kettle at\n",

      "There was no reply, and he raced up to her room.  It was empty, but\n",

      "\"There is a large supply in that cupboard.  Also india-rubber.  I am\n",
      "not sure if we have any india-rubber, but that can be procured.  And a\n",
      "ruler,\" he said, \"for drawing straight lines and all that sort of\n",
      "thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a typewriter?\" she suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones smacked his forehead with unnecessary violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A typewriter!  I knew this office wanted something.  I said to Ali\n",
      "yesterday: 'You silly old ass----'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you have a girl?\" she said disappointedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ali,\" said Bones, \"is the name of a native man person who is devoted\n",
      "to me, body and soul.  He has been, so to speak, in the family for\n",
      "years,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's a man,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ali.  Spelt A-l-y; it's Arabic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A native?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course he will not be in your way,\" ha hastened to explain.  \"He is\n",
      "in Bournemouth just now.  He had sniffles.\"  he explained rapidly, \"and\n",
      "then he used to go to sleep, and snore.  I hate people who snore, don't\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed again.  This was the most amazing of all possible employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" Bones went on, \"I snore a bit myself.  All thinkers do--I\n",
      "mean all brainy people.  Not being a jolly old snorer yourself----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other tenants or the satellites of other tenants who occupied the\n",
      "palatial buildings wherein the office of Bones was situated saw, some\n",
      "few minutes later, a bare-headed young man dashing down the stairs\n",
      "three at a time; met him, half an hour later, staggering up those same\n",
      "stairs handicapped by a fifty-pound typewriter in one hand, and a chair\n",
      "in the style of the late Louis Quinze in the other, and wondered at the\n",
      "urgency of his movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to tell you,\" said the girl, \"that I know very little about\n",
      "shorthand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shorthand is quite unnecessary, my dear--my jolly old stenographer,\"\n",
      "said Bones firmly.  \"I object to shorthand on principle, and I shall\n",
      "always object to it.  If people,\" he went on, \"were intended to write\n",
      "shorthand, they would have been born without the alphabet.  Another\n",
      "thing----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One moment, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she said.  \"I don't know a great deal about\n",
      "typewriting, either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones beamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There I can help you,\" he said.  \"Of course it isn't necessary that\n",
      "you should know anything about typewriting.  But I can give you a few\n",
      "hints,\" he said.  \"This thing, when you jiggle it up and down, makes\n",
      "the thingummy-bob run along.  Every time you hit one of these\n",
      "letters----  I'll show you....  Now, suppose I am writing 'Dear Sir,' I\n",
      "start with a 'D.'  Now, where's that jolly old 'D'?\"  He scowled at the\n",
      "keyboard, shook his head, and shrugged his shoulders.  \"I thought so,\"\n",
      "he said; \"there ain't a 'D.'  I had an idea that that wicked old----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the 'D,'\" she pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones spent a strenuous but wholly delightful morning and afternoon.\n",
      "He was half-way home to his chambers in Curzon Street before he\n",
      "realized that he had not fixed the rather important question of salary.\n",
      "He looked forward to another pleasant morning making good that lapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his habit to remain late at his office at least three nights a\n",
      "week, for Bones was absorbed in his new career.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Schemes Ltd.\" was no meaningless title.  Bones had schemes which\n",
      "embraced every field of industrial, philanthropic, and social activity.\n",
      "He had schemes for building houses, and schemes for planting rose trees\n",
      "along all the railway tracks.  He had schemes for building motor-cars,\n",
      "for founding labour colonies, for harnessing the rise and fall of the\n",
      "tides, he had a scheme for building a theatre where the audience sat on\n",
      "a huge turn-table, and, at the close of one act, could be twisted\n",
      "round, with no inconvenience to themselves, to face a stage which has\n",
      "been set behind them.  Piqued by a certain strike which had caused him\n",
      "a great deal of inconvenience, he was engaged one night working out a\n",
      "scheme for the provision of municipal taxicabs, and he was so absorbed\n",
      "in his wholly erroneous calculations that for some time he did not hear\n",
      "the angry voices raised outside the door of his private office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it was that that portion of his mind which had been left free\n",
      "to receive impressions was wholly occupied with a scheme--which\n",
      "appeared in no books or records--for raising the wages of his new\n",
      "secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But presently the noise penetrated even to him, and he looked up with a\n",
      "touch of annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this hour of the night! ...  Goodness gracious ... respectable\n",
      "building!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His disjointed comments were interrupted by the sound of a scuffle, an\n",
      "oath, a crash against his door and a groan, and Bones sprang to the\n",
      "door and threw it open.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he did so a man who was leaning against it fell in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut the door, quick!\" he gasped, and Bones obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor who had so rudely irrupted himself was a man of middle age,\n",
      "wearing a coarse pea-jacket and blue jersey of a seaman, his peaked hat\n",
      "covered with dust, as Bones perceived later, when the sound of\n",
      "scurrying footsteps had died away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was gripping his left arm as if in pain, and a thin trickle of\n",
      "red was running down the back of his big hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, my jolly old mariner,\" said Bones anxiously.  \"What's the\n",
      "matter with you?  What's the trouble, dear old sea-dog?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked up at him with a grimace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They nearly got it, the swine!\" he growled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rolled up his sleeve and, deftly tying a handkerchief around a red\n",
      "patch, chuckled:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is only a scratch,\" he said.  \"They've been after me for two days,\n",
      "Harry Weatherall and Jim Curtis.  But right's right all the world over.\n",
      "I've suffered enough to get what I've got--starved on the high seas,\n",
      "and starved on Lomo Island.  Is it likely that I'm going to let them\n",
      "share?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You sit down, my dear old fellow,\" he said sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man thrust his hands laboriously into his inside pocket and pulled\n",
      "out a flat oilskin case.  From this he extracted a folded and faded\n",
      "chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was coming up to see a gentleman in these buildings,\" he said, \"a\n",
      "gentleman named Tibbetts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones opened his mouth to speak, but stopped himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me and Jim Curtis and young Harry, we were together in the _Serpent\n",
      "Queen_--my name's Dibbs.  That's where we got hold of the yarn about\n",
      "Lomo Island, though we didn't believe there was anything in it.  But\n",
      "when this Dago died----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which Dago?\" asked Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Dago that knew all about it,\" said Mr. Dibbs impatiently, \"and we\n",
      "come to split up his kit in his mess-bag, I found this.\"  He shook the\n",
      "oilskin case in Bones's face.  \"Well, the first thing I did, when I got\n",
      "to Sydney, was to desert, and I got a chap from Wellington to put up\n",
      "the money to hire a boat to take me to Lomo.  We were wrecked on Lomo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you got there?\" said Bones sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six weeks I was on Lomo.  Ate nothing but crabs, drank nothing but\n",
      "rain-water.  But the stuff was there all right, only\"--he was very\n",
      "emphatic, was this simple old sea-dog--\"it wasn't under the third tree,\n",
      "but the fourth tree.  I got down to the first of the boxes, and it was\n",
      "as much as I could do to lift it out.  I couldn't trust any of the\n",
      "Kanaka boys who were with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally,\" said Bones.  \"An' I'll bet they didn't trust you, the\n",
      "naughty old Kanakas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here,\" said Mr. Dibbs, and he pulled out of his pocket a handful\n",
      "of gold coins which bore busts of a foreign-looking lady and gentleman.\n",
      "\"Spanish gold, that is,\" he said.  \"There was four thousand in the\n",
      "little box.  I filled both my pockets, and took 'em back to Sydney when\n",
      "we were picked up.  I didn't dare try in Australia.  'That gold will\n",
      "keep,' I says to myself.  'I'll get back to England and find a man who\n",
      "will put up the money for an expedition'--a gentleman, you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quite understand,\" said Bones, all a-quiver with excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then I met Harry and Jim.  They said they'd got somebody who would\n",
      "put the money up, an American fellow, Rockefeller.  Have you ever heard\n",
      "of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've heard of him,\" said Bones; \"he's got a paraffin mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be he has, it may be he hasn't,\" said Mr. Dibbs and rose.\n",
      "\"Well, sir, I'm very much obliged to you for your kindness.  If you'll\n",
      "direct me to Mr. Tibbetts's office----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dramatic moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Bones simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blank incredulity was on the face of Mr. Dibbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?\" he said.  \"But I thought Mr. Tibbetts was an older gentleman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old treasure-finder,\" said Bones, \"be assured I am Mr. Tibbetts.\n",
      "This is my office, and this is my desk.  People think I am older\n",
      "because----\"  He smiled a little sadly, then: \"Sit down!\" he thundered.\n",
      "\"Let us go into this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went into the matter, and the City clocks were booming one when he\n",
      "led his mariner friend into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was late at the office the next morning, because he was young and\n",
      "healthy and required nine hours of the deepest slumber that Morpheus\n",
      "kept in stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grey-eyed girl was typing at a very respectable speed the notes\n",
      "Bones had given her the evening before.  There was a telegram awaiting\n",
      "him, which he read with satisfaction.  Then:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave your work, my young typewriter,\" said Bones imperiously.  \"I\n",
      "have a matter of the greatest importance to discuss with you!  See that\n",
      "all the doors are closed,\" he whispered; \"lock 'em if necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly think that's necessary,\" said the girl.  \"You see, if anybody\n",
      "came and found all the doors locked----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Idiot!\" said Bones, very red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" said the startled girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was speaking to me,\" said Bones rapidly.  \"This is a matter of the\n",
      "greatest confidence, my jolly old Marguerite \"--he paused, shaking at\n",
      "his temerity, for it was only on the previous day that he had\n",
      "discovered her name--\"a matter which requires tact and discretion,\n",
      "young Marguerite----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't say it twice,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well once,\" said Bones, brightening up.  \"That's a bargain--I'll call\n",
      "you Marguerite once a day.  Now, dear old Marguerite, listen to this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She listened with the greatest interest, jotting down the preliminary\n",
      "expenses.  Purchase of steamer, five thousand pounds; provisioning of\n",
      "same, three thousand pounds, etc., etc.  She even undertook to make a\n",
      "copy of the plan which Mr. Dibbs had given into his charge, and which\n",
      "Bones told her had not left him day nor night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I put it in my pyjama pocket when I went to bed,\" he explained\n",
      "unnecessarily, \"and----\"  He began to pat himself all over,\n",
      "consternation in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you left it in your pyjama pocket,\" said the girl quietly.  \"I'll\n",
      "telephone to your house for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phew!\" said Bones.  \"It seems incredible.  I must have been robbed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" said the girl; \"it is probably under your pillow.\n",
      "Do you keep your pyjamas under your pillow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said Bones, \"is a matter which I never discuss in public.  I\n",
      "hate to disappoint you, dear old Marguerite----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" said the girl, with such a simulation of regret that Bones\n",
      "dissolved into a splutter of contrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "A commissionaire and a taxicab brought the plan, which was discovered\n",
      "where the girl in her wisdom had suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not so sure how much money I'm going to make out of this,\" said\n",
      "Bones off-handedly, after a thorough and searching examination of the\n",
      "project.  \"It is certain to be about three thousand pounds--it may be a\n",
      "million or two million.  It'll be good for you, dear old stenographer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have decided,\" said Bones, playing with his paper-knife, \"to allow\n",
      "you a commission of seven and a half per cent. on all profits.  Seven\n",
      "and a half per cent. on two million is, roughly, fifty thousand\n",
      "pounds----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed her refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like to be fair,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You like to be generous,\" she corrected him, \"and because I am a girl,\n",
      "and pretty----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I say,\" protested Bones feebly--\"oh, really you are not pretty at\n",
      "all.  I am not influenced by your perfectly horrible young face,\n",
      "believe me, dear old Miss Marguerite.  Now, I've a sense of fairness, a\n",
      "sense of justice----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, listen to me, Mr. Tibbetts.\"  She swung her chair round to face\n",
      "him squarely.  \"I've got to tell you a little story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones listened to that story with compressed lips and folded arms.  He\n",
      "was neither shocked nor amazed, and the girl was surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold hard, young miss,\" he said soberly.  \"If this is a jolly old\n",
      "swindle, and if the naughty mariner----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His name is Webber, and he is an actor,\" she interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And dooced well he acted,\" admitted Bones.  \"Well, if this is so, what\n",
      "about the other johnny who's putting up ten thousand to my fifteen\n",
      "thousand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a facer for the girl, and Bones glared his triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what the wicked old ship-sailer said.  Showed me the money,\n",
      "an' I sent him straight off on the job.  He said he'd got a Stock\n",
      "Exchange person named Morris----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Morris!\" gasped the girl.  \"That is my step-father!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones jumped up, a man inspired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The naughty old One, who married your sainted mother?\" he gurgled.\n",
      "\"My miss!  My young an' jolly old Marguerite!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down at his desk, yanked open the drawer, and slapped down his\n",
      "cheque-book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three thousand pounds,\" he babbled, writing rapidly.  \"You'd better\n",
      "keep it for her, dear old friend of Faust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't understand,\" she said, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Telegram,\" said Bones briefly.  \"Read it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She picked up the buff form and read.  It was postmarked from Cowes,\n",
      "and ran:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In accordance your telegraphed instructions, have sold your\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are calling this afternoon for my fifteen thousand,\" said Bones,\n",

      "mysteriously from nowhere in the track of the staggering buck, possess\n",
      "qualities which are shared by certain favoured human beings.  No\n",
      "newspaper announced the fact that there had arrived in the City of\n",
      "London a young man tremendously wealthy and as tremendously\n",
      "inexperienced.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no meetings of organized robber gangs, where masked men laid\n",
      "nefarious plans and plots, but the instinct which called the kite to\n",
      "his quarry and the carrion to the kill brought many strangers--who were\n",
      "equally strange to Bones and to one another--to the beautiful office\n",
      "which he had fitted for himself for the better furtherance of his\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day a respectable man brought to Mr. Tibbetts a plan of a\n",
      "warehouse.  He came like a gale of wind, almost before Bones had\n",
      "digested the name on the card which announced his existence and\n",
      "identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "His visitor was red-faced and big, and had need to use a handkerchief\n",
      "to mop his brow and neck at intervals of every few minutes.  His\n",
      "geniality was overpowering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the startled Bones could ask his business, he had put his hat\n",
      "upon one chair, hooked his umbrella on another, and was unrolling, with\n",
      "that professional tremblement of hand peculiar to all who unroll large\n",
      "stiff sheets of paper, a large coloured plan, a greater portion of\n",
      "which was taken up by the River Thames, as Bones saw at a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that blue stood for water, and, twisting his neck, he read\n",
      "\"Thames.\"  He therefore gathered that this was the plan of a property\n",
      "adjacent to the London river.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a busy man; and I'm a busy man,\" said the stentorian man\n",
      "breathlessly.  \"I've just bought this property, and if it doesn't\n",
      "interest you I'll eat my hat!  My motto is small profits and quick\n",
      "returns.  Keep your money at work, and you won't have to.  Do you see\n",
      "what I mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old hurricane,\" said Bones feebly, \"this is awfully interesting,\n",
      "and all that sort of thing, but would you be so kind as to explain why\n",
      "and where--why you came in in this perfectly informal manner?  Against\n",
      "all the rules of my office, dear old thing, if you don't mind me\n",
      "snubbing you a bit.  You are sure you aren't hurt?\" he asked.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have?\" he said, not without a hint of incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Bones calmly.  \"Yes, I have just heard you say it, Honest\n",
      "John Staines.  Any relation to John o' Gaunt?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This made the visitor look up sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" he said, his laugh lacking sincerity.  \"You're a bit of a\n",
      "joker, Mr. Tibbetts.  Now, what do you say to this?  This is Stivvins'\n",
      "Wharf and Warehouse.  Came into the market on Saturday, and I bought it\n",
      "on Saturday.  The only river frontage which is vacant between Greenwich\n",
      "and Gravesend.  Stivvins, precious metal refiner, went broke in the\n",
      "War, as you may have heard.  Now, I am a man of few words and\n",
      "admittedly a speculator.  I bought this property for fifteen thousand\n",
      "pounds.  Show me a profit of five thousand pounds and it's yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Bones could speak, he stopped him with a gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me tell you this: if you like to sit on that property for a month,\n",
      "you'll make a sheer profit of twenty thousand pounds.  You can afford\n",
      "to do it--I can't.  I tell you there isn't a vacant wharfage between\n",
      "Greenwich and Gravesend, and here you have a warehouse with thirty\n",
      "thousand feet of floor-space, derricks--derrick, named after the\n",
      "hangman of that name: I'll bet you didn't know that?--cranes,\n",
      "everything in----  Well, it's not in apple-pie order,\" he admitted,\n",
      "\"but it won't take much to make it so.  What do you say?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Honest John Staines swallowed something and repeated his proposition.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nothing doing!\" he said.  \"Wharves and ships--_no!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Honest John was not the kind that accepts refusal without protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What I'll do,\" said he confidentially, \"is this: I'll leave the matter\n",
      "for twenty-four hours in your hands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, go, my reliable old wharf-seller,\" said Bones.  \"I never go up the\n",

      "\n",
      "He brought his knuckly fist down upon the unoffending desk, and Honest\n",
      "John watched hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, if--yes, it's an idea!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones seized paper, and his long-feathered quill squeaked violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it--a thousand members at ten pounds a year, four hundred\n",
      "bedrooms at, say, ten shillings a night----  How many is four hundred\n",
      "times ten shillings multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five?  Well,\n",
      "let's say twenty thousand pounds.  That's it!  A club!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A club?\" said Honest John blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A river club.  You said Greenhithe--that's somewhere near Henley,\n",
      "isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Honest John sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" he said gently, \"it's in the other direction--toward the\n",

      "\n",

      "near Maidenhead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's in the opposite direction from London,\" said the perspiring Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones's interest evaporated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No good to me, my old speculator.  Wharves!  Bah!\"\n",

      "He shook his head violently, and Mr. Staines aroused himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said simply; \"I'll leave\n",

      "Think it over.  I'll call to-morrow afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No go, nothin' doin'.  Finish this palaver, dear old Honesty!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyway, no harm is done,\" urged Mr. Staines.  \"I ask you, is there any\n",
      "harm done?  You have the option for twenty-four hours.  I'll roll the\n",
      "plans up so that they won't be in the way.  Good morning!\"\n",

      "He was out of the office door before Bones could as much as deliver the\n",
      "preamble to the stern refusal he was preparing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At three o'clock that afternoon came two visitors.  They sent in a card\n",
      "bearing the name of a very important Woking firm of land agents, and\n",
      "they themselves were not without dignity of bearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a stout gentleman and a thin gentleman, and they tiptoed into\n",
      "the presence of Bones with a hint of reverence which was not\n",
      "displeasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have come on a rather important matter,\" said the thin gentleman.\n",
      "\"We understand you have this day purchased Stivvins' Wharf----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Staines had no right to sell it?\" burst in the stout man explosively.\n",
      "\"A dirty mean trick, after all that he promised us!  It is just his way\n",
      "of getting revenge, selling the property to a stranger!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Sole\"--the thin gentleman's voice and attitude were eloquent of\n",
      "reproof--\"_please_ restrain yourself!  My partner is annoyed,\" he\n",
      "explained \"and not without reason.  We offered fifty thousand pounds\n",
      "for Stivvins', and Staines, in sheer malice, has sold the\n",
      "property--which is virtually necessary to our client--literally behind\n",
      "our backs.  Now, Mr. Tibbetts, are you prepared to make a little profit\n",
      "and transfer the property to us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But----\" began Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will give you sixty thousand,\" said the explosive man.  \"Take it or\n",
      "leave it--sixty thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear old Boniface,\" protested Bones, \"I haven't bought the\n",

      "buy it, but I assure you I didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The stout man looked at him with glazed eyes, pulled himself together,\n",
      "and suggested huskily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you will buy it--at his price--and transfer it to us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?  Nothing to do with me, my old estate agent and auctioneer.\n",
      "Buy it yourself.  Good afternoon.  _Good_ afternoon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He ushered them out in a cloud of genial commonplaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the street they looked at one another, and then beckoned Mr.\n",
      "Staines, who was waiting on the other side of the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This fellow is either as wide as Broad Street or he's a babe in arms,\"\n",
      "said the explosive man huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't he fall?\" asked the anxious Staines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not noticeably,\" said the thin man.  \"This is your scheme, Jack, and\n",

      "trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Staines looked very serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give him the day,\" he begged.  \"I'll try him to-morrow--I haven't lost\n",
      "faith in that lad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Bones, he made an entry in his secret ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A person called Stains and two perrsons called Sole Bros.  Brothers\n",

      "\"_Note_.--1st Felow called himself Honest John!!  I dout if I dought\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones finished his entries, locked away his ledger, and crossed the\n",
      "floor to the door of the outer office.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knocked respectfully, and a voice bade him come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not usual for the principal of a business to knock respectfully\n",
      "or otherwise on the door of the outer office, but then it is not usual\n",
      "for an outer office to house a secretary of such transcendental\n",
      "qualities, virtue, and beauty as were contained in the person of Miss\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland.\n",
      "\n",

      "welcome and reproof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she pleaded, \"do not knock at my door.  Don't\n",
      "you realize that it isn't done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old Marguerite,\" said Bones solemnly, \"a new era has dawned in\n",
      "the City.  As jolly old Confusicus says: 'The moving finger writes, and\n",
      "that's all about it.'  Will you deign to honour me with your presence\n",
      "in my sanctorum, and may I again beg of you\"--he leant his bony\n",
      "knuckles on the ornate desk which he had provided for her, and looked\n",
      "down upon her soberly--\"may I again ask you, dear old miss, to let me\n",
      "change offices?  It's a little thing, dear old miss.  I'm never, never\n",
      "goin' to ask you to dinner again, but this is another matter.  I am out\n",
      "of my element in such a place as----\"  He waved his hand disparagingly\n",
      "towards his sanctum.  \"I'm a rough old adventurer, used to sleeping in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Anyway, you're not supposed to sleep in the office,\" smiled the girl,\n",
      "rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones pushed open the door for her, bowed as she passed, and followed\n",
      "her.  He drew a chair up to the desk, and she sat down without further\n",
      "protest, because she had come to know that his attentions, his\n",
      "extravagant politeness and violent courtesies, signified no more than\n",
      "was apparent--namely, that he was a great cavalier at heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you ought to know,\" he said gravely, \"that an attempt was made\n",
      "this morning to rob me of umpteen pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To rob you?\" said the startled girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To rob me,\" said Bones, with relish.  \"A dastardly plot, happily\n",
      "frustrated by the ingenuity of the intended victim.  I don't want to\n",
      "boast, dear old miss.  Nothing is farther from my thoughts or wishes,\n",
      "but what's more natural when a fellow is offered a----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A precious metal refiner's----  That's rum,\" said Bones.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of all the rummy old coincidences,\" said Bones, with restrained and\n",
      "hollow enthusiasm--\"why, only this morning I was reading in _Twiddly\n",

      "called 'Things You Ought to Know,' which is honestly worth the\n",

      "\n",
      "He paced the room energetically, changing the aspect of his face with\n",
      "great rapidity, as wandering thoughts crowded in upon him and vast\n",
      "possibilities shook their alluring banners upon the pleasant scene he\n",
      "conjured.  Suddenly he pulled himself together, shot out his cuffs,\n",
      "opened and closed all the drawers of his desk as though seeking\n",
      "something--he found it where he had left it, hanging on a peg behind\n",
      "the door, and put it on--and said with great determination and\n",
      "briskness:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stivvins' Wharf, Greenhithe.  You will accompany me.  Bring your\n",

      "\n",

      "ignoring the little things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But still she demurred, being a very sane, intelligent girl, with an\n",
      "imagination which produced no more alluring mental picture than a cold\n",
      "and draughty drive, a colder and draughtier and even more depressing\n",
      "inspection of a ruined factory, and such small matters as a lost lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bones was out of the room, in the street, had flung himself upon a\n",
      "hesitant taxi-driver, had bullied and cajoled him to take a monstrous\n",
      "and undreamt-of journey for a man who, by his own admission, had only\n",
      "sufficient petrol to get his taxi home, and when the girl came down she\n",
      "found Bones, with his arm entwined through the open window of the door,\n",

      "\n",

      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones returned to his office alone.  The hour was six-thirty, and he\n",
      "was a very quiet and thoughtful young man.  He almost tiptoed into his\n",
      "office, closed and locked the door behind him, and sat at his desk with\n",
      "his head in his hands for the greater part of half an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he unrolled the plan of the wharf, hoping that his memory had not\n",

      "arms and partners in misfortune, the same opinions relating in a most\n",
      "disparaging manner to the genius, the foresight, and the constructive\n",
      "ability of one who in his exuberant moments described himself as Honest\n",
      "John.\n",
      "\n",
      "The explosive gentleman had just concluded a fanciful picture of what\n",

      "\n",
      "Honest John took the telegram and opened it.  He read it and gasped.\n",

      "his eyes shining, his face slightly flushed.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say he's going to buy it?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a catch,\" said the explosive man suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not on your life,\" replied the scornful Staines.  \"Where does the\n",
      "catch come in?  We've done nothing he could catch us for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's have a look at that telegram again,\" said the thin man, and,\n",
      "having read it in a dazed way, remarked: \"He'll wait for you at the\n",
      "office until nine.  Well, Jack, nip up and fix that deal.  Take the\n",
      "transfers with you.  Close it and take his cheque.  Take anything he'll\n",

      "Honest John breathed heavily through his nose and staggered from the\n",

      "unjustified, for Mr. Staines was labouring under acute emotions.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He folded the cheque for twenty thousand pounds reverently and put it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, this is the rummiest go I have ever known,\" said the explosive\n",
      "man profoundly.  \"You don't think he expects us to call in the morning\n",

      "\n",
      "Staines shook his head.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Stivvins' Wharf was difficult of approach by night.  It lay off the\n",
      "main Woolwich Road, at the back of another block of factories, and to\n",
      "reach its dilapidated entrance gates involved an adventurous march\n",
      "through a number of miniature shell craters.  Night, however, was\n",
      "merciful in that it hid the desolation which is called Stivvins' from\n",
      "the fastidious eye of man.  Mr. Sole, who was not aesthetic and by no\n",
      "means poetical, admitted that Stivvins' gave him the hump.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten o'clock by the time they had reached the wharf, and\n",
      "half-past ten before their hammering on the gate aroused the attention\n",
      "of the night-watchman--who was also the day-watchman--who occupied what\n",
      "had been in former days the weigh-house, which he had converted into a\n",
      "weatherproof lodging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hullo!\" he said huskily.  \"I was asleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recognized Mr. Sole, and led the way to his little bunk-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, Tester,\" said Sole, who had appointed the man, \"did a young\n",
      "swell come down here to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did,\" said Mr. Tester, \"and a young lady.  They gave Mr. Staines's\n",

      "\"That's what I asked,\" said Mr. Tester, with satisfaction.  \"I told 'em\n",
      "Stivvins dealt with all kinds of metal, so the gent says: 'What about\n",
      "gold?'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about gold?\" repeated Mr. Staines thoughtfully.  \"And what did\n",
      "you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, as a matter of fact,\" explained Tester, \"I happen to know this\n",
      "place, living in the neighbourhood, and I used to work here about eight\n",
      "years ago, so I took 'em down to the vault.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the vault?\" said Mr. Staines.  \"I didn't know there was a vault.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's under the main office.  You must have seen the place,\" said\n",
      "Tester.  \"There's a big steel door with a key in it--at least, there\n",
      "was a key in it, but this young fellow took it away with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Staines gripped his nearest companion in sin, and demanded huskily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did they find anything in--in the vault?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blessed if I know!\" said the cheerful Tester, never dreaming that he\n",
      "was falling very short of the faith which at that moment, and only at\n",
      "that moment, had been reposed in him.  \"They just went in.  I've never\n",
      "been inside the place myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you stood outside, like a--a----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blinking image!\" said the explosive companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You stood outside like a blinking image, and didn't attempt to go in,\n",
      "and see what they were looking at?\" said Mr. Staines heatedly.  \"How\n",
      "long were they there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About ten minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then they came out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tester nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did they bring anything out with them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Mr. Tester emphatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did this fellow--what's his name?--look surprised or upset?\" persisted\n",
      "the cross-examining Honest John.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was a bit upset, now you come to mention it, agitated like, yes,\"\n",
      "said Tester, reviewing the circumstances in a new light.  \"His 'and\n",
      "was, so to speak, shaking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merciful Moses!\"  This pious ejaculation was from Mr. Staines.  \"He\n",
      "took away the key, you say.  And what are you supposed to be here for?\"\n",
      "asked Mr. Staines violently.  \"You allow this fellow to come and take\n",
      "our property away.  Where is the place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tester led the way across the littered yard, explaining en route that\n",
      "he was fed up, and why he was fed up, and what they could do to fill\n",
      "the vacancy which would undoubtedly occur the next day, and where they\n",
      "could go to, so far as he was concerned, and so, unlocking one rusty\n",
      "lock after another, passed through dark and desolate offices, full of\n",
      "squeaks and scampers, down a short flight of stone steps to a most\n",
      "uncompromising steel door at which they could only gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was at his office early the following rooming, but he was not\n",
      "earlier than Mr. Staines, who literally followed him into his office\n",
      "and slammed down a slip of paper under his astonished and gloomy eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey, hey, what's this?\" said Bones irritably.  \"What the dooce is\n",
      "this, my wicked old fiddle fellow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your cheque,\" said Mr. Staines firmly.  \"And I'll trouble you for the\n",
      "key of our strong-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The key of your strong-room?\" repeated Bones.  \"Didn't I buy this\n",
      "property?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did and you didn't.  To cut a long story short, Mr. Tibbetts, I\n",
      "have decided not to sell--in fact, I find that I have done an illegal\n",
      "thing in selling at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shrugged his shoulders.  Remember that he had slept, or\n",
      "half-slept, for some nine hours, and possibly his views had undergone a\n",
      "change.  What he would have done is problematical, because at that\n",
      "moment the radiant Miss Whitland passed into her office, and Bones's\n",
      "acute ear heard the snap of her door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One moment,\" he said gruffly, \"one moment, old Honesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He strode through the door which separated the private from the public\n",
      "portion of his suite, and Mr. Staines listened.  He listened at varying\n",
      "distances from the door, and in his last position it would have\n",
      "required the most delicate of scientific instruments to measure the\n",
      "distance between his ear and the keyhole.  He heard nothing save the\n",
      "wail of a Bones distraught, and the firm \"No's\" of a self-possessed\n",
      "female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, after a heart-breaking silence Bones strode out, and Mr. Staines\n",
      "did a rapid sprint, so that he might be found standing in an attitude\n",
      "of indifference and thought near the desk.  The lips of Bones were\n",
      "tight and compressed.  He opened the drawer, pulled out the transfers,\n",
      "tossed them across to Mr. Staines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Key,\" said Bones, chucking it down after the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up his cheque and tore it into twenty pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's all,\" said Bones, and Mr. Staines beat a tremulous retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the man had gone, Bones returned to the girl who was sitting at\n",
      "her table before her typewriter.  It was observable that her lips were\n",
      "compressed too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young Miss Whitland,\" said Bones, and his voice was hoarser than ever,\n",
      "\"never, never in my life will I ever forgive myself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl a little wearily, \"haven't I\n",
      "told you that I have forgiven you?  And I am sure you had no horrid\n",
      "thought in your mind, and that you just acted impulsively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones bowed his head, at once a sign of agreement and a crushed spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fact remains, dear old miss,\" he said brokenly, \"that I did kiss\n",
      "you in that beastly old private vault.  I don't know what made me do\n",
      "it,\" he gulped, \"but I did it.  Believe me, young miss, that spot was\n",
      "sacred.  I wanted to buy the building to preserve it for all time, so\n",
      "that no naughty old foot should tread upon that hallowed ground.  You\n",
      "think that's nonsense!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Tibbetts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, I say, romantic and all that sort of rot.\"  Bones threw out\n",
      "his arms.  \"I must agree with you.  But, believe me, Stivvins' Wharf is\n",
      "hallowed ground, and I deeply regret that you would not let me buy it\n",
      "and turn it over to the jolly old Public Trustee or one of those\n",
      "johnnies....  You do forgive me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed up in his face, and then Bones laughed, and they laughed\n",
      "together.\n",

      "The door of the private office opened and after a moment closed.  It\n",
      "was, in fact, the private door of the private office, reserved\n",
      "exclusively for the use of the Managing Director of Schemes Limited.\n",
      "Nevertheless, a certain person had been granted the privilege of\n",
      "ingress and egress through that sacred portal, and Mr. Tibbetts, yclept\n",
      "Bones, crouching over his desk, the ferocity of his countenance\n",
      "intensified by the monocle which was screwed into his eye, and the\n",
      "terrific importance of his correspondence revealed by his disordered\n",
      "hair and the red tongue that followed the movements of his pen, did not\n",
      "look up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put it down, put it down, young miss,\" he murmured, \"on the table, on\n",
      "the floor, anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no answer, and suddenly Bones paused and scowled at the\n",
      "half-written sheet before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That doesn't look right.\"  He shook his head.  \"I don't know what's\n",
      "coming over me.  Do you spell 'cynical' with one 'k' or two?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw a brown-faced man, with laughing grey eyes, a tall man in a long\n",
      "overcoat, carrying a grey silk hat in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me, my jolly old intruder,\" said Bones with dignity, \"this is a\n",
      "private----\"  Then his jaw dropped and he leant on the desk for\n",
      "support.  \"Not my----  Good heavens!\" he squeaked, and then leapt\n",
      "across the room, carrying with him the flex of his table lamp, which\n",
      "fell crashing to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham, you poisonous old reptile!\"  He seized the other's hand in his\n",
      "bony paw, prancing up and down, muttering incoherently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, my jolly old Captain.  Let me take your overcoat.  Well!\n",
      "Well!  Well!  Give me your hat, dear old thing--dear old Captain, I\n",
      "mean.  This is simply wonderful!  This is one of the most amazin'\n",
      "experiences I've ever had, my dear old sportsman and officer.  How long\n",
      "have you been home?  How did you leave the Territory?  Good heavens!\n",
      "We must have a bottle on this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, you noisy devil,\" said Hamilton, pushing his erstwhile\n",
      "subordinate into a chair, and pulling up another to face him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So this is your boudoir!\"  He glanced round admiringly.  \"It looks\n",
      "rather like the waiting-room of a _couturière_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear old thing,\" said the shocked Bones, \"I beg you, if you please,\n",
      "remember, remember----\"  He lowered his voice, and the last word was in\n",
      "a hoarse whisper, accompanied by many winks, nods, and pointings at and\n",
      "to a door which led from the inner office apparently to the outer.\n",
      "\"There's a person, dear old man of the world--a young person--well\n",
      "brought up----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the----\" began Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be peeved!\"  Bones's knowledge of French was of the haziest.\n",
      "\"Remember, dear old thing,\" he said solemnly, wagging his inky\n",
      "forefinger, \"as an employer of labour, I must protect the young an'\n",
      "innocent, my jolly old skipper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton looked round for a missile, and could find nothing better than\n",
      "a crystal paper-weight, which looked too valuable to risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'_Couturière_,'\" he said acidly, \"is French for 'dressmaker.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"French,\" said Bones, \"is a language which I have always carefully\n",
      "avoided.  I will say no more--you mean well, Ham.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter followed a volley of inquiries, punctuated at intervals by\n",
      "genial ceremony, for Bones would rise from his chair, walk solemnly\n",
      "round the desk, and as solemnly shake hands with his former superior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Bones,\" said Hamilton at last, \"will you tell me what you are\n",
      "doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Business,\" he said briefly.  \"A deal now and again, dear old officer.\n",
      "Make a thousand or so one week, lose a hundred or so the next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what are you doing?\" persisted Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Bones shrugged, but with more emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose,\" he confessed, with a show of self-deprecation which his\n",
      "smugness belied, \"I suppose I am one of those jolly old spiders who sit\n",
      "in the centre of my web, or one of those perfectly dinky little tigers\n",
      "who sit in my jolly old lair, waiting for victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, it's cruel sport\"--he shrugged again, toying with his ivory\n",
      "paper-knife--\"but one must live.  In the City one preys upon other\n",
      "ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do the other ones do any preying at all?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up went Bones's eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They try,\" he said tersely, and with compressed lips.  \"Last week a\n",
      "fellow tried to sell me his gramophone, but I had a look at it.  As I\n",
      "suspected, it had no needle.  A gramophone without a needle,\" said\n",
      "Bones, \"as you probably know, my dear old musical one, is wholly\n",
      "useless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you can buy them at a bob a box,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones's face fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you really?\" he demanded.  \"You are not pulling my leg, or\n",
      "anything?  That's what the other fellow said.  I do a little gambling,\"\n",
      "Bones went on, \"not on the Stock Exchange or on the race-course, you\n",
      "understand, but in Exchanges.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Money Exchanges?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones bowed his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For example,\" he said, \"to-day a pound is worth thirty-two francs,\n",
      "to-morrow it is worth thirty-four francs.  To-day a pound is worth four\n",
      "dollars seventy-seven----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact, it is three dollars ninety-seven,\" interrupted\n",
      "Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ninety-seven or seventy-seven,\" said Bones irritably, \"what is four\n",
      "shillings to men like you or me, Hamilton?  We can well afford it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear chap,\" said Hamilton, pardonably annoyed, \"there is a\n",
      "difference of four shillings between your estimate and the rate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is four shillings to you or me?\" asked Bones again, shaking his\n",
      "head solemnly.  \"My dear old Ham, don't be mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a discreet tap on the door, and Bones rose with every\n",
      "evidence of agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't stir, dear old thing,\" he pleaded in a husky whisper.  \"Pretend\n",
      "not to notice, dear old Ham.  Don't be nervous--wonderful young\n",
      "lady----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, clearing his throat noisily, \"Come in!\" he roared in the tone\n",
      "that a hungry lion might have applied to one of the early Christian\n",
      "martyrs who was knocking by mistake on the door of his den.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all injunctions, Hamilton did look, and he did stare, and\n",
      "he did take a great deal of notice, for the girl who came in was well\n",
      "worth looking at.  He judged her to be about the age of twenty-one.\n",
      "\"Pretty\" would be too feeble a word to employ in describing her.  The\n",
      "russet-brown hair, dressed low over her forehead, emphasized the\n",
      "loveliness of eyes set wide apart and holding in their clear depths all\n",
      "the magic and mystery of womanhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was dressed neatly.  He observed, too, that she had an open book\n",
      "under her arm and a pencil in her hand, and it dawned upon him slowly\n",
      "that this radiant creature was--Bones's secretary!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones's secretary!\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at Bones, and that young man, very red in the face, avoided\n",
      "his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was standing by the desk, in the attitude of an after-dinner\n",
      "speaker who was stuck for the right word.  In moments of extreme\n",
      "agitation Bones's voice became either a growl or a squeak--the bottom\n",
      "register was now in exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did--did you want me, young miss?\" he demanded gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl at the door hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry--I didn't know you were engaged.  I wanted to see you about\n",
      "the Abyssinian----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in, come in, certainly,\" said Bones more gruffly than ever.  \"A\n",
      "new complication, young miss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laid a paper on the desk, taking no more notice of Hamilton than if\n",
      "he were an ornament on the chimney-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first instalment of the purchase price is due to-day,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it?\" said Bones, with his extravagant surprise.  \"Are you certain,\n",
      "young miss?  This day of all days--and it's a Thursday, too,\" he added\n",
      "unnecessarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl smiled and curled her lip, but only for a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" said Bones, \"it's a matter of serious importance.  The\n",
      "cheque, jolly old young miss, we will sign it and you will send it off.\n",
      "Make it out for the full amount----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the three thousand pounds?\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the three thousand pounds,\" repeated Bones soberly.  He put in his\n",
      "monocle and glared at her.  \"For the three thousand pounds,\" he\n",
      "repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood waiting, and Bones stood waiting, he in some embarrassment as\n",
      "to the method by which the interview might be terminated and his\n",
      "secretary dismissed without any wound to her feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think to-morrow would do for the cheque?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Bones.  \"Why not?  To-morrow's Friday,\n",
      "ain't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She inclined her head and walked out of the room, and Bones cleared his\n",
      "throat once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man turned to meet Hamilton's accusing eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Hamilton gently, \"who is the lady?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is the lady?\" repeated Bones, with a cough.  \"The lady is my\n",
      "secretary, dear old inquisitor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I gather,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is my secretary,\" repeated Bones.  \"An extremely sensible young\n",
      "woman, extremely sensible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be silly,\" said Hamilton.  \"Plenty of people are sensible.  When\n",
      "you talk about sensible young women, you mean plain young women.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true,\" said Bones; \"I never thought of that.  What a naughty\n",
      "old mind you have, Ham.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed inclined to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, dear old son,\" said Bones, with a brisk return to his\n",
      "what-can-I-do-for-you air, \"to business!  You've come, dear old thing,\n",
      "to consult me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're surprisingly right,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Bones, trying three drawers of his desk before he could\n",
      "find one that opened, \"have a cigar, and let us talk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton took the proffered weed and eyed it suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this one that was given to you, or one that you bought?\" he\n",
      "demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That, my jolly old officer,\" said Bones, \"is part of a job lot that I\n",
      "bought pretty cheap.  I've got a rare nose for a bargain----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you a rare nose for a cigar, that's the point?\" asked Hamilton,\n",
      "as he cut off the end and lit it gingerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would I give you a bad cigar?\" asked the indignant Bones.  \"A gallant\n",
      "old returned warrior, comrade of my youth, and all that sort of thing!\n",
      "My dear old Ham!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you in a minute,\" said Hamilton, and took two draws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, who was no cigar smoker, watched the proceedings anxiously.\n",
      "Hamilton put the cigar down very gently on the corner of the desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mind if I finish this when nobody's looking?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it all right?\" asked Bones.  \"Gracious heavens!  I paid fifty\n",
      "shillings a hundred for those!  Don't say I've been done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you could be done at that price,\" said Hamilton, and\n",
      "brushed the cigar gently into the fireplace.  \"Yes, I have come to\n",
      "consult you, Bones,\" he went on.  \"Do you remember some eight months\n",
      "ago I wrote to you telling you that I had been offered shares in a\n",
      "motor-car company?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones had a dim recollection that something of the sort had occurred,\n",
      "and nodded gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seemed a pretty good offer to me,\" said Hamilton reflectively.\n",
      "\"You remember I told you there was a managership attached to the\n",
      "holding of the shares?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shifted uneasily in his chair, sensing a reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear old fellow----\" he began feebly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton.  \"I wrote to you and asked you your\n",
      "advice.  You wrote back, telling me to have nothing whatever to do with\n",
      "the Plover Light Car Company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I?\" said Bones.  \"Well, my impression was that I advised you to\n",
      "get into it as quickly as you possibly could.  Have you my letter, dear\n",
      "old thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Bones triumphantly, \"there you are!  You jolly old rascal,\n",
      "you are accusing me of putting you off----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you wait, you talkative devil?\" said Hamilton.  \"I pointed out to\n",
      "you that the prospects were very alluring.  The Company was floated\n",
      "with a small capital----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Bones interrupted, and this time by rising and walking solemnly\n",
      "round the table to shake hands with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hamilton, dear old skipper,\" he pleaded.  \"I was a very busy man at\n",
      "that time.  I admit I made a mistake, and possibly diddled you out of a\n",
      "fortune.  But my intention was to write to you and tell you to get into\n",
      "it, and how I ever came to tell you _not_ to get into it--well, my poor\n",
      "old speculator, I haven't the slightest idea!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Company----\" began Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, I know,\" said Bones, shaking his head sadly and fixing his\n",
      "monocle--a proceeding rendered all the more difficult by the fact that\n",
      "his hand never quite overtook his face.  \"It was an error on my part,\n",
      "dear old thing.  I know the Company well.  Makes a huge profit!  You\n",
      "can see the car all over the town.  I think the jolly old Partridge----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plover,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plover, I mean.  They've got another kind of car called the\n",
      "Partridge,\" explained Bones.  \"Why, it's one of the best in the market.\n",
      "I thought of buying one myself.  And to think that I put you off that\n",
      "Company!  Tut, tut!  Anyway, dear old man,\" he said, brightening up,\n",
      "\"most of the good fish is in the sea, and it only goes bad when it\n",
      "comes out of the sea.  Have you ever noticed that, my dear old\n",
      "naturalist?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a moment.  Will you be quiet?\" said the weary Hamilton.  \"I'm\n",
      "trying to tell you my experiences.  I put the money--four thousand\n",
      "pounds--into this infernal Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I put the money into the Company, I tell you, against your advice.\n",
      "The Company is more or less a swindle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones sat down slowly in his chair and assumed his most solemn and\n",
      "business-like face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, it keeps within the law, but it's a swindle, none the less.\n",
      "They've got a wretched broken-down factory somewhere in the North, and\n",
      "the only Plover car that's ever been built was made by a Scottish\n",
      "contractor at a cost of about twice the amount which the Company people\n",
      "said that they would charge for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did I say?\" said Bones quietly.  \"Poor old soul, I do not give\n",
      "advice without considering matters, especially to my dearest friend.  A\n",
      "company like this is obviously a swindle.  You can tell by the\n",
      "appearance of the cars----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was only one car ever made,\" interrupted Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have said car,\" said the unperturbed Bones.  \"The very\n",
      "appearance of it shows you that the thing is a swindle from beginning\n",
      "to end.  Oh, why did you go against my advice, dear old Ham?  Why did\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You humbug!\" said the wrathful Hamilton.  \"You were just this minute\n",
      "apologising for giving me advice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said Bones cheerfully, \"was before I'd heard your story.  Yes,\n",
      "Ham, you've been swindled.\"  He thought a moment.  \"Four thousand\n",
      "pounds!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And his jaw dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones had been dealing in large sums of late, and had forgotten just\n",
      "the significance of four thousand pounds to a young officer.  He was\n",
      "too much of a little gentleman to put his thoughts into words, but it\n",
      "came upon him like a flash that the money which Hamilton had invested\n",
      "in the Plover Light Car Company was every penny he possessed in the\n",
      "world, a little legacy he had received just before Bones had left the\n",
      "Coast, plus all his savings for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham,\" he said hollowly, \"I am a jolly old rotter!  Here I've been\n",
      "bluffing and swanking to you when I ought to have been thinking out a\n",
      "way of getting things right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you're not going to get things right, Bones,\" he said.\n",
      "\"The only thing I did think was that you might possibly know something\n",
      "about this firm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At any other moment Bones would have claimed an extensive acquaintance\n",
      "with the firm and its working, but now he shook his head, and Hamilton\n",
      "sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sanders told me to come up and see you,\" he said.  \"Sanders has great\n",
      "faith in you, Bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones went very red, coughed, picked up his long-plumed pen and put it\n",
      "down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any rate,\" said Hamilton, \"you know enough about the City to tell\n",
      "me this--is there any chance of my getting this money back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones rose jerkily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham,\" he said, and Hamilton sensed a tremendous sincerity in his\n",
      "voice, \"that money's going to come back to you, or the name of Augustus\n",
      "Tibbetts goes down in the jolly old records as a failure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A minute later Captain Hamilton found himself hand-shook from the room.\n",
      "Here for Bones was a great occasion.  With both elbows on the desk, and\n",
      "two hands searching his hair, he sat worrying out what he afterwards\n",
      "admitted was the most difficult problem that ever confronted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After half an hour's hair-pulling he went slowly across his beautiful\n",
      "room and knocked discreetly on the door of the outer office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Marguerite Whitland had long since grown weary of begging him to\n",
      "drop this practice.  She found it a simple matter to say \"Come in!\" and\n",
      "Bones entered, closing the door behind him, and stood in a deferential\n",
      "attitude two paces from the closed door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young miss,\" he said quietly, \"may I consult you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may even consult me,\" she said as gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a very curious problem, dear old Marguerite,\" said Bones in a\n",
      "low, hushed tone.  \"It concerns the future of my very dearest\n",
      "friend--the very dearest friend in all the world,\" he said\n",
      "emphatically, \"of the male sex,\" he added hastily.  \"Of course,\n",
      "friendships between jolly old officers are on a different plane, if you\n",
      "understand me, to friendships between--I mean to say, dear old thing,\n",
      "I'm not being personal or drawing comparisons, because the feeling I\n",
      "have for you----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here his eloquence ran dry.  She knew him now well enough to be neither\n",
      "confused nor annoyed nor alarmed when Bones broke forth into an\n",
      "exposition of his private feelings.  Very calmly she returned the\n",
      "conversation to the rails.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a matter which concerns a very dear friend of yours,\" she said\n",
      "suggestively, and Bones nodded and beamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you guessed that,\" he said admiringly.  \"You're the jolliest\n",
      "old typewriter that ever lived!  I don't suppose any other young woman\n",
      "in London would have----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, they would,\" she said.  \"You'd already told me.  I suppose\n",
      "that you've forgotten it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, to cut a long story short, dear old Miss Marguerite,\" said\n",
      "Bones, leaning confidentially on the table and talking down into her\n",
      "upturned lace, \"I must find the whereabouts of a certain rascal or\n",
      "rascals, trading or masquerading, knowingly or unknowingly, to the best\n",
      "of my knowledge and belief, as the----\"  He stopped and frowned.  \"Now,\n",
      "what the dickens was the name of that bird?\" he said.  \"Pheasant,\n",
      "partridge, ostrich, bat, flying fish, sparrow--it's something to do\n",
      "with eggs.  What are the eggs you eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seldom eat eggs,\" said the girl quietly, \"but when I do they are the\n",
      "eggs of the common domestic fowl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ain't him,\" said Bones, shaking his head.  \"No, it's--I've got\n",
      "it--Plover--the Plover Light Car Company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl made a note on her pad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want you to get the best men in London to search out this Company.\n",
      "If necessary, get two private detectives, or even three.  Set them to\n",
      "work at once, and spare no expense.  I want to know who's running the\n",
      "company--I'd investigate the matter myself, but I'm so fearfully\n",
      "busy--and where their offices are.  Tell the detectives,\" said Bones,\n",
      "warming to the subject, \"to hang around the motor-car shops in the West\n",
      "End.  They're bound to hear a word dropped here and there, and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quite understand,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones put out his lean paw and solemnly shook the girl's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If,\" he said, with a tremble in his voice, \"if there's a typewriter in\n",
      "London that knows more than you, my jolly old Marguerite, I'll eat my\n",
      "head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On which lines he made his exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes later the girl came into the office with a slip of paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Plover Motor Car Company is registered at 604, Gracechurch\n",
      "Street,\" she said.  \"It has a capital of eighty thousand pounds, of\n",
      "which forty thousand pounds is paid up.  It has works at Kenwood, in\n",
      "the north-west of London, and the managing director is Mr. Charles O.\n",
      "Soames.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones could only look at her open-mouthed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where on earth did you discover all this surprising information, dear\n",
      "miss?\" he asked, and the girl laughed quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can even tell you their telephone number,\" she said, \"because it\n",
      "happens to be in the Telephone Book.  The rest I found in the Stock\n",
      "Exchange Year Book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shook his head in silent admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's a typewriter in London----\" he began, but she had fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later Bones had evolved his magnificent idea.  It was an idea\n",
      "worthy of his big, generous heart and his amazing optimism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Charles O. Soames, who sat at a littered table in his\n",
      "shirt-sleeves, was a man with a big shock of hair and large and heavily\n",
      "drooping moustache, and a black chin.  He smoked a big, heavy pipe,\n",
      "and, at the moment Bones was announced, his busy pencil was calling\n",
      "into life a new company offering the most amazing prospects to the\n",
      "young and wealthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the card from the hands of his very plain typist, and\n",
      "suppressed the howl of joy which rose to his throat.  For the name of\n",
      "Bones was known in the City of London, and it was the dream of such men\n",
      "as Charles O. Soames that one day they would walk from the office of\n",
      "Mr. Augustus Tibbetts with large parcels of his paper currency under\n",
      "each arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up from his chair and slipped on a coat, pushed the\n",
      "prospectus he was writing under a heap of documents--one at least of\n",
      "which bore a striking family likeness to a county court writ--and\n",
      "welcomed his visitor decorously and even profoundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In _re_ Plover Car,\" said Bones briskly.  He prided himself upon\n",
      "coming to the point with the least possible delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The face of Mr. Soames fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you want to buy a car?\" he said.  He might have truly said \"the\n",
      "car,\" but under the circumstances he thought that this would be\n",
      "tactless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear old company promoter,\" said Bones, \"I do not want to buy your\n",
      "car.  In fact, you have no cars to sell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've had a lot of labour trouble,\" said Mr. Soames hurriedly.\n",
      "\"You've no idea of the difficulties in production--what with the\n",
      "Government holding up supplies--but in a few months----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know all about that,\" said Bones.  \"Now, I'm a man of affairs and a\n",
      "man of business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said this so definitely that it sounded like a threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm putting it to you, as one City of London business person to\n",
      "another City of London business person, is it possible to make cars at\n",
      "your factory?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Soames rose to the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I assure you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said earnestly, \"it is possible.  It\n",
      "wants a little more capital than we've been able to raise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the trouble with all Mr. Soames's companies, a long list of\n",
      "which appeared on a brass plate by the side of his door.  None of them\n",
      "were sufficiently capitalised to do anything except to supply him with\n",
      "his fees as managing director.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones produced a dinky little pocket-book from his waistcoat and read\n",
      "his notes, or, rather, attempted to read his notes.  Presently he gave\n",
      "it up and trusted to his memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've got forty thousand pounds subscribed to your Company,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do--I will take over your\n",
      "shares at a price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Soames swallowed hard.  Here was one of the dreams of his life\n",
      "coming true.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are four million shares issued,\" Bones went on, consulting his\n",
      "notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh?\" said Mr. Soames in a shocked voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones looked at his book closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it four hundred thousand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forty thousand,\" said Mr. Soames gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a matter of indifference,\" said Bones.  \"The point is, will you\n",
      "sell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The managing director of the Plover Light Car Company pursed his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he said, \"the shares are at a premium--not,\" he added\n",
      "quickly, \"that they are being dealt with on 'Change.  We have not\n",
      "troubled to apply for quotations.  But I assure you, my dear sir, the\n",
      "shares are at a premium.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At a small premium,\" said Mr. Soames hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones made no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At a half a crown premium,\" said Mr. Soames pleadingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At par,\" said Bones, in his firmest and most business-like tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The matter was not settled there and then, because matters are not\n",
      "settled with such haste in the City of London.  Bones went home to his\n",
      "office with a new set of notes, and wired to Hamilton, asking him to\n",
      "come on the following day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great scheme that Bones worked out that night, with the aid of\n",
      "the sceptical Miss Whitland.  His desk was piled high with technical\n",
      "publications dealing with the motor-car industry.  The fact that he was\n",
      "buying the Company in order to rescue a friend's investment passed\n",
      "entirely from his mind in the splendid dream he conjured from his\n",
      "dubious calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Plover car should cover the face of the earth.  He read an article\n",
      "on mass production, showing how a celebrated American produced a\n",
      "thousand or a hundred thousand cars a day--he wasn't certain which--and\n",
      "how the car, in various parts, passed along an endless table, between\n",
      "lines of expectant workmen, each of whom fixed a nut or unfixed a nut,\n",
      "so that, when the machine finally reached its journey's end, it left\n",
      "the table under its own power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones designed a circular table, so that, if any of the workmen forgot\n",
      "to fix a bar or a nut or a wheel, the error could be rectified when the\n",
      "car came round again.  The Plover car should be a household word.  Its\n",
      "factories should spread over North London, and every year there should\n",
      "be a dinner with Bones in the chair, and a beautiful secretary on his\n",
      "right, and Bones should make speeches announcing the amount of the\n",
      "profits which were to be distributed to his thousands of hands in the\n",
      "shape of bonuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton came promptly at ten o'clock, and he came violently.  He flew\n",
      "into the office and banged a paper down on Bones's desk with the\n",
      "enthusiasm of one who had become the sudden possessor of money which he\n",
      "had not earned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old thing, dear old thing,\" said Bones testily, \"remember dear\n",
      "old Dicky Orum--preserve the decencies, dear old Ham.  You're not in\n",
      "the Wild West now, my cheery boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" shouted Hamilton, \"you're my mascot!  Do you know what has\n",
      "happened?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower your voice, lower your voice, dear old friend,\" protested Bones.\n",
      "\"My typewriter mustn't think I am quarrelling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He came last night,\" said Hamilton, \"just as I was going to bed, and\n",
      "knocked me up.\"  He was almost incoherent in his joy.  \"He offered me\n",
      "three thousand five hundred pounds for my shares, and I took it like a\n",
      "shot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones gaped at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Offered you three thousand five hundred?\" he gasped.  \"Good heavens!\n",
      "You don't mean to say----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the tragedy of that moment.  Here was Bones, full of great\n",
      "schemes for establishing a car upon the world's markets, who had in his\n",
      "head planned extensive works, who saw in his mind's eye vistas of long,\n",
      "white-covered festive boards, and heard the roar of cheering which\n",
      "greeted him when he rose to propose continued prosperity to the firm.\n",
      "Consider also that his cheque was on the table before him, already made\n",
      "out and signed.  He was at that moment awaiting the arrival of Mr.\n",
      "Soames.\n",

      "standing as though stricken to stone at the sight of Bones and Hamilton\n",
      "in consultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning,\" said Bones.\n",

      "\n",

      "back of his head, and, without another word, strode from the office,\n",
      "and they heard the door slam behind him.  Bones and Hamilton exchanged\n",
      "glances; then Bones picked up the cheque from the desk and slowly tore\n",
      "it up.  He seemed to spend his life tearing up expensive cheques.\n",

      "Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, called \"Bones,\" made money by sheer luck--he\n",
      "made more by sheer artistic judgment.  That is a fact which an old\n",
      "friend sensed a very short time after he had renewed his acquaintance\n",
      "with his sometime subordinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Bones had the curious habit of making money in quite a different\n",
      "way from that which he planned--as, for example, in the matter of the\n",
      "great oil amalgamation.  In these days of aeroplane travel, when it is\n",
      "next to impossible to watch the comings and goings of important\n",
      "individuals, or even to get wind of directors' meetings, the City is\n",
      "apt to be a little jumpy, and to respond to wild rumours in a fashion\n",
      "extremely trying to the nerves of conservative brokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were rumours of a fusion of interests between the Franco-Persian\n",
      "Oil Company and the Petroleum Consolidated--rumours which set the\n",
      "shares of both concerns jumping up and down like two badly trained\n",
      "jazzers.  The directorate of both companies expressed their surprise\n",
      "that a credulous public could accept such stories, and both M. Jorris,\n",
      "the emperor of the Franco-Persian block, and George Y. Walters, the\n",
      "prince regent of the \"Petco,\" denied indignantly that any amalgamation\n",
      "was even dreamt of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before these denials came along Bones had plunged into the oil market,\n",
      "making one of the few flutters which stand as interrogation marks\n",
      "against his wisdom and foresight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not lose; rather, he was the winner by his adventure.  The\n",
      "extent of his immediate gains he inscribed in his private ledger; his\n",
      "ultimate and bigger balance he entered under a head which had nothing\n",
      "to do with the oil gamble--which was just like Bones, as Hamilton\n",
      "subsequently remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton was staying with Sanders--late Commissioner of a certain group\n",
      "of Territories--and Bones was the subject of conversation one morning\n",
      "at breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third at the table was an exceedingly pretty girl, whom the maid\n",
      "called \"Madame,\" and who opened several letters addressed to \"Mrs.\n",
      "Sanders,\" but who in days not long past had been known as Patricia\n",
      "Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones is wonderful,\" said Sanders, \"truly wonderful!  A man I know in\n",
      "the City tells me that most of the things he touches turn up trumps.\n",
      "And it isn't luck or chance.  Bones is developing a queer business\n",
      "sense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is his romantic soul which gets him there,\" he said.  \"Bones will\n",
      "not look at a proposition which hasn't something fantastical behind it.\n",
      "He doesn't know much about business, but he's a regular whale on\n",
      "adventure.  I've been studying him for the past month, and I'm\n",
      "beginning to sense his method.  If he sees a logical and happy end to\n",
      "the romantic side of any new business, he takes it on.  He simply\n",
      "carries the business through on the back of a dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl looked up from the coffee-pot she was handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you made up your mind, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About going in with Bones?\"  Hamilton smiled.  \"No, not yet.  Bones is\n",
      "frantically insistent, has had a beautiful new Sheraton desk placed in\n",
      "his office, and says that I'm the influence he wants, but----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I understand,\" said Sanders.  \"You feel that he is doing it\n",
      "all out of sheer generosity and kindness.  That would be like Bones.\n",
      "But isn't there a chance that what he says is true--that he does want a\n",
      "corrective influence?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe that is so,\" said Captain Hamilton doubtfully.  \"And then\n",
      "there's the money.  I don't mind investing my little lot, but it would\n",
      "worry me to see Bones pretending that all the losses of the firm came\n",
      "out of his share, and a big slice of the profits going into mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't let that worry you,\" said his sister quietly.  \"Bones is\n",
      "too nice-minded to do anything so crude.  Of course, your money is\n",
      "nothing compared with Bones's fortune, but why don't you join him on\n",
      "the understanding that the capital of the Company should be----  How\n",
      "much would you put in?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, make the capital eight thousand.  Bones could always lend the\n",
      "Company money.  Debentures--isn't that the word?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders smiled in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a remarkable lady,\" he said.  \"From where on earth did you get\n",
      "your ideas on finance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She went red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I lunched with Bones yesterday,\" she said.  \"And here is the post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence, babbler,\" said Hamilton.  \"Before we go any farther, what\n",
      "about this matter of partnership you were discussing with Patricia?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid distributed the letters.  One was addressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captin Captian Hamilton, D.S.O.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From Bones,\" said Hamilton unnecessarily, and Bones's letter claimed\n",
      "first attention.  It was a frantic and an ecstatic epistle, heavily\n",
      "underlined and exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old old Ham,\" it ran, \"you simply must join me in _magnifficant_\n",
      "new sceme sheme plan!  Wonderfull prophits profets!  The most\n",
      "extraordiny _chance_ for a fortune...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For Heaven's sake, what's this?\" asked Hamilton, handing the letter\n",
      "across to his sister and indicating an illegible line.  \"It looks like\n",
      "'a bad girl's leg' to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear!\" said the shocked Mrs. Sanders, and studied the vile\n",
      "caligraphy.  \"It certainly does look like that,\" she admitted, \"and----\n",
      "I see!  'Legacy' is the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A bad girl's legacy is the titel of the play story picture\" (Bones\n",
      "never crossed anything out).  \"There's a studyo at Tunbridge and two\n",

      "    \"BONES.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From which I gather that Bones is taking a header into the cinema\n",
      "business,\" said Sanders.  \"What do you say, Hamilton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton thought a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll see Bones,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived in Town soon after ten, but Bones had been at his office two\n",
      "hours earlier, for the fever of the new enterprise was upon him, and\n",
      "his desk was piled high with notes, memoranda, price lists and trade\n",
      "publications.  (Bones, in his fine rage of construction, flew to the\n",
      "technical journals as young authors fly to the Thesaurus.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As Hamilton entered the office, Bones glared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A chair,\" said the young man peremptorily.  \"No time to be lost, dear\n",
      "old artist.  Time is on the wing, the light is fadin', an' if we want\n",
      "to put this jolly old country--God bless it!--in the forefront----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones put down his pen and leant back in his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham,\" he said, \"I had a bit of a pow-pow with your sacred and sainted\n",
      "sister, bless her jolly old heart.  That's where the idea arose.  Are\n",
      "you on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm on,\" said Hamilton, and there was a moving scene.  Bones shook his\n",
      "hands and spoke broken English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's your perfectly twee little desk, dear old officer,\" he said,\n",
      "pointing to a massive piece of furniture facing his own.  \"And there's\n",
      "only one matter to be settled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was obviously uncomfortable, and Hamilton would have reached for his\n",
      "cheque-book, only he knew his Bones much better than to suppose that\n",
      "such a sordid matter as finance could cause his agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham,\" said Bones, clearing his throat and speaking with an effort,\n",
      "\"old comrade of a hundred gallant encounters, and dear old friend----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the game?\" asked Hamilton suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no game,\" said the depressed Bones.  \"This is a very serious\n",
      "piece of business, my jolly old comrade.  As my highly respected\n",
      "partner, you're entitled to use the office as you like--come in when\n",
      "you like, go home when you like.  If you have a pain in the tum-tum,\n",
      "dear old friend, just go to bed and trust old Bones to carry on.  Use\n",
      "any paper that's going, help yourself to nibs--you'll find there's some\n",
      "beautiful nibs in that cupboard--in fact, do as you jolly well like;\n",
      "but----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But?\" repeated Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On one point alone, dear old thing,\" said Bones miserably, yet\n",
      "heroically, \"we do not share.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that?\" asked Hamilton, not without curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My typewriter is my typewriter,\" said Bones firmly, and Hamilton\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You silly ass!\" he said.  \"I'm not going to play with your typewriter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just what I mean,\" said Bones.  \"You couldn't have put it\n",
      "better, dear old friend.  Thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He strode across the room, gripped Hamilton's hand and wrung it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old thing, she's too young,\" he said brokenly.  \"Hard life ...\n",
      "terrible experience...  Play with her young affections, dear old thing?\n",
      "No...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who the dickens are you talking about?  You said typewriter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said typewriter,\" agreed Bones gravely.  \"I am speaking about my----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A light dawned upon Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean your secretary?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean my secretary,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heavens, Bones!\" scoffed Hamilton.  \"Of course I shan't bother\n",
      "her.  She's your private secretary, and naturally I wouldn't think of\n",
      "giving her work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or orders,\" said Bones gently.  \"That's a point, dear old thing.  I\n",
      "simply couldn't sit here and listen to you giving her orders.  I should\n",
      "scream.  I'm perfectly certain I can trust you, Ham.  I know what you\n",
      "are with the girls, but there are times----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know what I am with the girls?\" said the wrathful Hamilton.  \"What\n",
      "the dickens do you know about me, you libellous young devil?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones raised his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will not refer to the past,\" he said meaningly and was so\n",
      "impressive that Hamilton began to search his mind for some forgotten\n",
      "peccadillo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All that being arranged to our mutual satisfaction, dear old partner,\"\n",
      "said Bones brightly, \"permit me to introduce you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked to the glass-panelled door leading to the outer office, and\n",
      "knocked discreetly, Hamilton watching him in wonder.  He saw him\n",
      "disappear, closing the door after him.  Presently he came out again,\n",
      "following the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear young miss,\" said Bones in his squeakiest voice, a sure sign of\n",
      "his perturbation, \"permit me to introduce partner, ancient commander,\n",
      "gallant and painstaking, jolly old Captain Hamilton, D.S.O.--which\n",
      "stands, young typewriter, for Deuced Satisfactory Officer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl, smiling, shook hands, and Hamilton for the first time looked\n",
      "her in the face.  He had been amazed before by her classic beauty, but\n",
      "now he saw a greater intelligence than he had expected to find in so\n",
      "pretty a face, and, most pleasing of all, a sense of humour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones and I are very old friends,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hem!\" said Bones severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones?\" said the girl, puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally!\" murmured Bones.  \"Dear old Ham, be decent.  You can't\n",
      "expect an innocent young typewriter to think of her employer as\n",
      "'Bones.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm awfully sorry,\" Hamilton hastened to apologise, \"but you see,\n",
      "Bones and I----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dicky Orum,\" murmured Bones.  \"Remember yourself, Ham, old indiscreet\n",
      "one--Mr. Tibbetts.  And here's the naughty old picture-taker,\" he said\n",
      "in another tone, and rushed to offer an effusive welcome to a smart\n",
      "young man with long, black, wavy hair and a face reminiscent, to all\n",
      "students who have studied his many pictures, of Louis XV.  Strangely\n",
      "enough, his name was Louis.  He was even called Lew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, my dear Mr. Becksteine,\" said Bones.  \"Let me introduce you\n",
      "to my partner.  Captain Hamilton, D.S.O.--a jolly old comrade-in-arms\n",
      "and all that sort of thing.  My lady typewriter you know, and anyway,\n",
      "there's no necessity for your knowing her----  I mean,\" he said\n",
      "hastily, \"she doesn't want to know you, dear old thing.  Now, don't be\n",
      "peevish.  Ham, you sit there.  Becksteine will sit there.  You, young\n",
      "miss, will sit near me, ready to take down my notes as they fall from\n",
      "my ingenious old brain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bustle and confusion the embarrassing moment of Hamilton's\n",
      "introduction was forgotten.  Bones had a manuscript locked away in the\n",
      "bottom drawer of his desk, and when he had found the key for this, and\n",
      "had placed the document upon the table, and when he had found certain\n",
      "other papers, and when the girl was seated in a much more comfortable\n",
      "chair--Bones fussed about like an old hen--the proceedings began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had seen the derelict cinema company advertised in a technical\n",
      "journal, had been impressed with the amount of the impedimenta which\n",
      "accompanied the proprietorship of the syndicate, had been seized with a\n",
      "brilliant idea, bought the property, lock, stock, and barrel, for two\n",
      "thousand pounds, for which sum, as an act of grace, the late\n",
      "proprietors allowed him to take over the contract of Mr. Lew\n",
      "Becksteine, that amiable and gifted producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be remarked, in passing, that this arrangement was immensely\n",
      "satisfactory to the syndicate, which was so tied and bound to Mr.\n",
      "Becksteine for the next twelve months that to have cancelled his\n",
      "contract would have cost them the greater part of the purchase price\n",
      "which Bones paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the story,\" said Bones impressively.  \"And, partner Ham,\n",
      "believe me, I've read many, many stories in my life, but never, never\n",
      "has one touched me as this has.  It's a jolly old tear-bringer, Ham.\n",
      "Even a hardened, wicked old dev--old bird like you would positively\n",
      "dissolve.  You would really, dear old Ham, so don't deny it.  You know\n",
      "you've got one of the tenderest hearts in the world, you rascal!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and shook hands with Hamilton, though there was no necessity\n",
      "for him to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, clever old Becksteine thinks that this is going to be a scorcher.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A winner, a winner,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine, closing his eyes and\n",
      "shaking his head.  He spoke on this occasion very softly, but he could\n",
      "raise his voice to thrilling heights.  \"A sure winner, my dear sir.  I\n",
      "have been in the profession for twenty-seven years, and never in my\n",
      "life have I read a drama which contains so much heart appeal----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hear?\" said Bones in a hoarse whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"--so much genuine comedy----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"--so much that I might say goes straight to the passionate heart of\n",
      "the great public, as this remarkable, brilliantly planned, admirably\n",
      "planted, exquisitely balanced little cameo of real life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's to be a two-roller,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reeler,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reeler or roller, dear old thing; don't let's quarrel over how a\n",
      "thing's spelt,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who wrote it?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Becksteine coughed modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jolly old Becksteine wrote it,\" said Bones.  \"That man, Ham, is one of\n",
      "the most brilliant geniuses in this or any other world.  Aren't you?\n",
      "Speak up, old playwright.  Don't be shy, old thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Becksteine coughed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know anything about other worlds,\" he admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, this is my idea,\" said Bones, interrupting what promised to be a\n",
      "free and frank admission of Mr. Becksteine's genius.  \"I've worked the\n",
      "thing out, and I see just how we can save money.  In producing\n",
      "two-roller cinematographs--that's the technical term,\" explained Bones,\n",
      "\"the heavy expense is with the artistes.  The salaries that these\n",
      "people are paid!  My dear old Ham, you'd never believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you can avoid paying salaries,\" said Hamilton\n",

      "\"Of course, dear old thing.  But why pay outside actors?\" said Bones\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glared from one face to the other with a ferocity of expression\n",
      "which did no more than indicate the strength of his conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not keep the money in the family, dear old Ham?  That's what I ask\n",
      "you.  Answer me that.\"  He leaned back in his chair, thrust his hands\n",
      "in his trousers pockets, and blandly surveyed his discomfited audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you've got to have actors, my dear chap,\" said Hamilton.\n",

      "\"Naturally and necessarily,\" replied Bones, nodding with very large\n",

      "her jolly old name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is?\" asked the innocent Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is Frank Fearnot, the young and handsome soldier--well, not\n",
      "necessarily handsome, but pretty good-looking--who rescues the girl\n",
      "from her sad predicament?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that can't be me, anyway,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not,\" said Bones.  \"It is me!  Who is the gorgeous but sad old\n",
      "innocent one who's chased by you, Ham, till the poor little soul\n",
      "doesn't know which way to turn, until this jolly young officer steps\n",
      "brightly on the scene, whistling a merry tune, and, throwing his arms\n",
      "about her, saves her, dear old thing, from her fate--or, really, from a\n",
      "perfectly awful rotten time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is she?\" asked Hamilton softly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear old miss,\" he said, \"what do you think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do I think?\" asked the startled girl.  \"What do I think about\n",
      "what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a part,\" said Bones--\"there's one of the grandest parts that\n",
      "was ever written since Shakespeare shut his little copybook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not suggesting that I should play it?\" she asked, open-mouthed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Made for you, dear old typewriter, positively made for you, that\n",
      "part,\" murmured Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I shall do nothing so silly,\" said the girl, with a laugh.\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Tibbetts, you really didn't think that I'd do such a----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't finish the sentence, but Hamilton could have supplied the\n",
      "three missing words without any difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter followed a discussion, which in the main consisted of joint\n",
      "and several rejection of parts.  Marguerite Whitland most resolutely\n",
      "refused to play the part of the bad girl, even though Bones promised to\n",
      "change the title to \"The Good Girl,\" even though he wheedled his best,\n",
      "even though he struck attitudes indicative of despair and utter ruin,\n",
      "even though the gentle persuasiveness of Mr. Lew Becksteine was added\n",
      "to his entreaties.  And Hamilton as resolutely declined to have\n",
      "anything to do with the bad man.  Mr. Becksteine solved the difficulty\n",
      "by undertaking to produce the necessary actors and actresses at the\n",
      "minimum of cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you won't play, Bones?\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Bones.  \"I'm not so sure, dear old thing.  I've\n",
      "got a lot of acting talent in me, and I feel the part--that's a\n",
      "technical term you won't understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But surely, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl reproachfully, \"you won't\n",
      "allow yourself to be photographed embracing a perfectly strange lady?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Art, my dear old typewriter,\" he said.  \"She'll be no more to me than\n",
      "a bit of wood, dear old miss.  I shall embrace her and forget all about\n",
      "it the second after.  You need have no cause for apprehension, really\n",
      "and truly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not at all apprehensive,\" said the girl coldly, and Bones\n",

      "\n",
      "On the third day Hamilton went back to Twickenham a very weary man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones is really indefatigable,\" he said irritably, but yet admiringly.\n",
      "\"He has had those unfortunate actors rehearsing in the open fields, on\n",
      "the highways and byways.  Really, old Bones has no sense of decency.\n",
      "He's got one big scene which he insists upon taking in a private park.\n",
      "I shudder to think what will happen if the owner comes along and\n",
      "catches Bones and his wretched company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders laughed quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think he'll do with the film?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he'll sell it,\" said Hamilton.  \"I tell you, Bones is amazing.  He\n",
      "has found a City man who is interested in the film industry, a\n",
      "stockbroker or something, who has promised to see every bit of film as\n",
      "it is produced and give him advice on the subject; and, incredible as\n",
      "it may sound, the first half-dozen scenes that Bones has taken have\n",
      "passed muster.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who turns the handle of the camera?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Hamilton, trying not to laugh.  \"He practised the\n",

      "\n",
      "The fourth day it rained, but the fifth day Bones took his company in a\n",
      "hired motor into the country, and, blissfully ignoring such admonitions\n",
      "as \"Trespassers will be shot,\" he led the way over a wall to the sacred\n",
      "soil of an Englishman's stately home.  Bones wanted the wood, because\n",
      "one of his scenes was laid on the edge of a wood.  It was the scene\n",
      "where the bad girl, despairing of convincing anybody as to her inherent\n",
      "goodness, was taking a final farewell of the world before \"leaving a\n",
      "life which had held nothing but sadness and misunderstanding,\" to quote\n",
      "the title which was to introduce this touching episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones found the right location, fitted up his camera, placed the\n",
      "yellow-faced girl--the cinema artiste has a somewhat bilious appearance\n",
      "when facing the lens--and began his instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, you walk on here, dear old Miss What's-Your-Name.  You come from\n",
      "that tree with halting footsteps--like this, dear old thing.  Watch and\n",
      "learn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones staggered across the greensward, clasping his brow, sank on his\n",
      "knees, folded his arms across his chest, and looked sorrowfully at the\n",
      "heavens, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton screamed with laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behave yourself, naughty old sceptic,\" said Bones severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "After half an hour's preliminary rehearsal, the picture was taken, and\n",
      "Bones now prepared to depart; but Mr. Lew Becksteine, from whose hands\n",
      "Bones had taken, not only the direction of the play, but the very\n",
      "excuse for existence, let fall a few uncomfortable words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, in the sad, bored voice of an\n",
      "artiste who is forced to witness the inferior work of another, \"it is\n",
      "in this scene that the two lawyers must be taken, walking through the\n",
      "wood, quite unconscious of the unhappy fate which has overtaken the\n",
      "heiress for whom they are searching.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said Bones, and scratched his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked round for likely lawyers.  Hamilton stole gently away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, why the dickens didn't you remind me, you careless old producer,\n",
      "to bring two lawyers with me?\" asked Bones.  \"Dash it all, there's\n",
      "nothing here that looks like a lawyer.  Couldn't it be taken somewhere\n",
      "else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Becksteine had reached the stage where he was not prepared to make\n",
      "things easy for his employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Utterly impossible,\" he said; \"you must have exactly the same scenery.\n",
      "The camera cannot lie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones surveyed his little company, but without receiving any\n",
      "encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I might find a couple of fellows on the road,\" he suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is hardly likely,\" said Mr. Lew Becksteine, \"that you will discover\n",
      "in this remote country village two gentlemen arrayed in faultlessly\n",
      "fitting morning-coats and top-hats!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know so much about that,\" said the optimistic Bones, and took\n",
      "a short cut through the wood, knowing that the grounds made an abrupt\n",
      "turn where they skirted the main road.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was half-way through the copse when he stopped.  Now, Bones was a\n",
      "great believer in miracles, but they had to be very spectacular\n",
      "miracles.  The fact that standing in the middle of the woodland path\n",
      "were two middle-aged gentlemen in top-hats and morning-coats, seemed to\n",
      "Bones to be a mere slice of luck.  It was, in fact, a miracle of the\n",
      "first class.  He crept silently back, raced down the steps to where the\n",
      "little party stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Camera!\" he hissed.  \"Bring it along, dear old thing.  Don't make a\n",
      "noise!  Ham, old boy, will you help?  You other persons, stay where you\n",
      "are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton shouldered the camera, and on the way up the slope Bones\n",
      "revealed his fell intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no need to tell these silly old jossers what we're doing,\" he\n",
      "said.  \"You see what I mean, Ham, old boy?  We'll just take a picture\n",
      "of them as they come along.  Nobody will be any the wiser, and all\n",
      "we'll have to do will be to put a little note in.\"  All the time he was\n",
      "fixing the camera on the tripod, focussing the lens on a tree by the\n",
      "path.  (It was amazing how quickly Bones mastered the technique of any\n",
      "new hobby he took up.)\n",
      "\n",
      "From where Hamilton crouched in the bushes he could see the two men\n",
      "plainly.  His heart quaked, realising that one at least was possibly\n",
      "the owner of the property on which he was trespassing; and he had all\n",
      "an Englishman's horror of trespass.  They were talking together, these\n",
      "respectable gentlemen, when Bones began to turn the handle.  They had\n",
      "to pass through a patch of sunlight, and it was upon this that Bones\n",
      "concentrated.  Once one of them looked around as the sound of clicking\n",
      "came to him, but at that moment Bones decided he had taken enough and\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said he, as they gained the by-road where they had made their\n",
      "unauthorised entry into the park, \"is a good day's work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their car was on the main road, and to Hamilton's surprise he found the\n",
      "two staid gentlemen regarding it when the party came up.  They were\n",
      "regarding it from a high bank behind the wall--a bank which commanded a\n",
      "view of the road.  One of them observed the camera and said something\n",
      "in a low tone to the other; then the speaker walked down the bank,\n",
      "opened a little wicker door in the wall, and came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a most polite man, and tactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been taking pictures?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old fellow,\" said Bones.  \"I will not deceive you--we have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the--park, by any chance?\" asked the gentleman carelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones flinched.  He felt rather guilty, if the truth be told.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fact is----\" he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elderly man listened to the story of \"The Bad Girl's Legacy,\" its\n",
      "genesis, its remarkable literary qualities, and its photographic value.\n",
      "He seemed to know a great deal about cinematographs, and asked several\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you have an expert who sees the pieces as they are produced?\" he\n",
      "asked.  \"Who is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Tim Lewis,\" said Bones.  \"He's one of the----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lewis?\" said the other quickly.  \"Is that Lewis the stockbroker?  And\n",
      "does he see every piece you take?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Respected sir and park proprietor,\" he said, \"if we have trespassed, I\n",

      "transgressed the jolly old conventions--if we, as I say, took a picture\n",
      "of you and your fellow park proprietor without a thank-you-very-much, I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course, any extra expense you are put to as the result of\n",

      "He was waiting for Bones and Hamilton at nine o'clock that night in the\n",

      "and though the print was slightly speckled, it was a good one.\n",
      "\n",

      "other fraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "No better illustration of the working of this concealed quantity can be\n",
      "given than the story of the great jute sale and Miss Bertha Stegg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth about the Government speculation in jute is simply told.  It\n",
      "is the story of an official who, in the middle of the War, was seized\n",
      "with the bright idea of procuring enormous quantities of jute for the\n",
      "manufacture of sand-bags.  The fact that by this transaction he might\n",
      "have driven the jute lords of Dundee into frenzy did not enter into his\n",
      "calculations.  Nor did it occur to him that the advantageous position\n",
      "in which he hoped to place his Department depended for its attainment\n",
      "upon a total lack of foresight on the part of the Dundee merchants.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, Dundee had bought well and wisely.  It had\n",
      "sufficient stocks to meet all the demands which the Government made\n",
      "upon it; and when, after the War, the Department offered its purchase\n",
      "at a price which would show a handsome profit to the Government, Dundee\n",
      "laughed long and loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so there was left on the official hands, at the close of the War, a\n",
      "quantity of jute which nobody wanted, at a price which nobody would\n",
      "pay.  And then somebody asked a question in the House of Commons, and\n",
      "the responsible Secretary went hot all over, and framed the reply which\n",
      "an Under-secretary subsequently made in such terms as would lead the\n",
      "country to believe that the jute purchased at a figure beyond the\n",
      "market value was a valuable asset, and would one day be sold at a\n",
      "profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Augustus Tibbetts knew nothing about jute.  But he did read, almost\n",
      "every morning in the daily newspapers, how one person or another had\n",
      "made enormous purchases of linen, or of cloth, or of motor chassis,\n",
      "paying fabulous sums on the nail and walking off almost immediately\n",
      "with colossal profits; and every time Bones read such an account he\n",
      "wriggled in his chair and made unhappy noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one afternoon there came to his office a suave gentleman in\n",
      "frock-coat, carrying with him a card which was inscribed \"Ministry of\n",
      "Supplies.\"  And the end of that conversation was that Bones, all a\n",
      "twitter of excitement, drove to a gloomy office in Whitehall, where he\n",
      "interviewed a most sacred public official, to whom members of the\n",
      "public were not admitted, perhaps, more than four times a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton had watched the proceedings with interest and suspicion.  When\n",
      "Bones was mysterious he was very mysterious; and he returned that night\n",
      "in such a condition of mystery that none but a thought-reading\n",
      "detective could have unravelled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem infernally pleased with yourself, Bones,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\"What lamentable error have you fallen into?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old Ham,\" said Bones, with the helpless little laugh which\n",
      "characterised the very condition of mind which Hamilton had described,\n",
      "\"dear old pryer, wait till to-morrow.  Dear old thing, I wouldn't spoil\n",
      "it.  Read your jolly old newspaper, dear old inquirer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been to the police court?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Police court?  Police court?\" said Bones testily.  \"Good Heavens, lad!\n",
      "Why this jolly old vulgarity?  No, dear boy, live and learn, dear old\n",
      "thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton undoubtedly lived until the next morning, and learnt.  He saw\n",
      "the headlines the second he opened his newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    GREAT DEAL IN JUTE.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton was on his way to the office, and fell back in the corner of\n",
      "the railway carriage with a suppressed moan.  He almost ran to the\n",
      "office, to find Bones stalking up and down the room, dictating an\n",
      "interview to a reporter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One minute, one minute, dear old Ham,\" said.  Bones warningly.  And\n",
      "then, turning to the industrious journalist, he went on where Hamilton\n",
      "had evidently interrupted him.  \"You can say that I've spent a great\n",
      "deal of my life in fearfully dangerous conditions,\" he said.  \"You\n",
      "needn't say where, dear old reporter, just say 'fearfully dangerous\n",
      "conditions.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about jute?\" asked the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jute,\" said Bones with relish, \"or, as we call it, _Corcharis\n",
      "capsilaris_, is the famous jute tree.  I have always been interested in\n",
      "jute and all that sort of thing----  But you know what to say better\n",
      "than I can tell you.  You can also say that I'm young--no, don't say\n",
      "that.  Put it like this: 'Mr. Tibbetts, though apparently\n",
      "young-looking, bears on his hardened old face the marks of years spent\n",
      "in the service of his country.  There is a sort of sadness about his\n",
      "funny old eyes----'  You know what to say, old thing.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "for a million?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A million's a bit of an exaggeration, dear old sportsman,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact, it's about half that sum, and it needn't be paid\n",
      "for a month.  Here is the contract.\"  He smacked his lips and smacked\n",
      "the contract, which was on the table, at the same time.  \"Don't get\n",
      "alarmed, don't get peevish, don't get panicky, don't be a wicked old\n",
      "flutterer, Ham, my boy!\" he said.  \"I've reckoned it all out, and I\n",
      "shall make a cool fifty thousand by this time next week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will you pay for it?\" asked Hamilton, in a shaky voice.  \"I mean,\n",
      "how much a ton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones mentioned a figure, and Hamilton jotted down a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a friend, as it happened, in the jute trade--the owner of a big\n",
      "mill in Dundee--and to him he dispatched an urgent telegram.  After\n",
      "that he examined the contract at leisure.  On the fourth page of that\n",
      "interesting document was a paragraph, the seventh, to this effect:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Either parties to this contract may, for any reason whatsoever, by\n",
      "giving notice either to the Ministry of Supplies, Department 9, or to\n",
      "the purchaser at his registered office, within twenty-four hours of the\n",
      "signing of this contract, cancel the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He read this over to Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's rum,\" he said.  \"What is the idea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My jolly old captain,\" said Bones in his lordly way, \"how should I\n",
      "know?  I suppose it's in case the old Government get a better offer.\n",
      "Anyway, dear old timidity, it's a contract that I'm not going to\n",
      "terminate, believe me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next afternoon Bones and Hamilton returned from a frugal lunch at a\n",
      "near-by tavern, and reached the imposing entrance of the building in\n",
      "which New Schemes Limited was housed simultaneously--or perhaps it\n",
      "would be more truthful to say a little later--than a magnificent\n",
      "limousine.  It was so far ahead of them that the chauffeur had time to\n",
      "descend from his seat, open the highly-polished door, and assist to the\n",
      "honoured sidewalk a beautiful lady in a large beaver coat, who carried\n",
      "under her arm a small portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a certain swing to her shoulder as she walked, a certain\n",
      "undulatory movement of hip, which spoke of a large satisfaction with\n",
      "the world as she found it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, something of a connoisseur and painfully worldly, pursed his\n",
      "lips and broke off the conversation in which he was engaged, and which\n",
      "had to do with the prospective profits on his jute deal, and remarked\n",
      "tersely:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham, dear old thing, that is a chinchilla coat worth twelve hundred\n",
      "pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton, to whom the mysteries of feminine attire were honest\n",
      "mysteries, accepted the sensational report without demur.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The way you pick up these particular bits of information, Bones, is\n",
      "really marvellous to me.  It isn't as though you go out a lot into\n",
      "society.  It isn't as though women are fond of you or make a fuss of\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones coughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dicky Orum.  Remember, dear old Richard,\" he murmured.  \"My private\n",
      "life, dear old fellow, if you will forgive me snubbing you, is a matter\n",
      "on which nobody is an authority except A. Tibbetts, Esq.  There's a lot\n",
      "you don't know, dear old Ham.  I was thinking of writing a book about\n",
      "it, but it would take too long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time they reached the elevator, which descended in time to\n",
      "receive the beautiful lady in the brown coat.  Bones removed his hat,\n",
      "smoothed his glossy hair, and with a muttered \"After you, dear old\n",
      "friend.  Age before honesty,\" bundled Hamilton into the lift and\n",
      "followed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elevator stopped at the third floor, and the lady got out.  Bones,\n",
      "his curiosity overcoming his respect for age or his appreciation of\n",
      "probity, followed her, and was thrilled to discover that she made\n",
      "straight for his office.  She hesitated for a moment before that which\n",
      "bore the word \"Private,\" and passed on to the outer and general office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones slipped into his own room so quickly that by the time Hamilton\n",
      "entered he was sitting at his desk in a thoughtful and studious\n",
      "attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be said that the inner office was any longer entitled to the\n",
      "description of sanctum sanctorum.  Rather was the holy of holies the\n",
      "larger and less ornate apartment wherein sat A Being whose capable\n",
      "little fingers danced over complicated banks of keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communicating door opened and the Being appeared.  Hamilton,\n",
      "mindful of a certain agreement with his partner, pretended not to see\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a lady who wishes a private interview with you, Mr. Tibbetts,\"\n",
      "said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones turned with an exaggerated start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A lady?\" he said in a tone of incredulity.  \"Gracious Heavens!  This\n",
      "is news to me, dear old miss.  Show her in, please, show her in.  A\n",
      "private interview, eh?\"  He looked meaningly at Hamilton.  Hamilton did\n",
      "not raise his eyes--in accordance with his contract.  \"A private\n",
      "interview, eh?\" said Bones louder.  \"Does she want to see me by myself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you would like to see her in my room,\" said the girl.  \"I\n",
      "could stay here with Mr. Hamilton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones glared at the unconscious Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not necessary, dear old typewriter,\" he said stiffly.  \"Show\n",
      "the young woman in, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"young woman,\" came in.  Rather, she tripped and undulated and\n",
      "swayed from the outer office to the chair facing Bones, and Bones rose\n",
      "solemnly to greet her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Marguerite Whitland, the beautiful Being, who had surveyed the\n",
      "tripping and swaying and undulating with the same frank curiosity that\n",
      "Cleopatra might have devoted to a performing seal, went into her office\n",
      "and closed the door gently behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, sit down,\" said Bones.  \"And what can I do for you, young\n",
      "miss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl smiled.  It was one of those flashing smiles which make\n",
      "susceptible men blink.  Bones was susceptible.  Never had he been gazed\n",
      "upon with such kindness by a pair of such large, soft, brown eyes.\n",
      "Never had cheeks dimpled so prettily and so pleasurably, and seldom had\n",
      "Bones experienced such a sensation of warm embarrassment--not\n",
      "unpleasant--as he did now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I am being an awful nuisance to you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the\n",
      "lady.  \"You don't know my name, do you?  Here is my card.\"  She had it\n",
      "ready in her hand, and put it in front of him.  Bones waited a minute\n",
      "or two while he adjusted his monocle, and read:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"MISS BERTHA STEGG.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, he read it long before he had adjusted his\n",
      "monocle, but the official acknowledgment was subsequent to that\n",
      "performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said Bones, who on such occasions as these, or on such\n",
      "occasions as remotely resembled these, was accustomed to take on the\n",
      "air and style of the strong, silent man.  \"What can we do for you, my\n",
      "jolly old--Miss Stegg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a charity,\" blurted the girl, and sat back to watch the effect of\n",
      "her words.  \"Oh, I know what you business men are!  You simply hate\n",
      "people bothering you for subscriptions!  And really, Mr. Tibbetts, if I\n",
      "had to come to ask you for money, I would never have come at all.  I\n",
      "think it's so unfair for girls to pester busy men in their offices, at\n",
      "the busiest time of the day, with requests for subscriptions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones coughed.  In truth, he had never been pestered, and was enjoying\n",
      "the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, this is something much more pleasant, from my point of view,\" said\n",
      "the girl.  \"We are having a bazaar in West Kensington on behalf of the\n",
      "Little Tots' Recreation Fund.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A most excellent plan,\" said Bones firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton, an interested audience, had occasion to marvel anew at the\n",
      "amazing self-possession of his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is one of the best institutions that I know,\" Bones went on\n",
      "thoughtfully.  \"Of course, it's many years since I was a little tot,\n",
      "but I can still sympathise with the jolly old totters, dear young miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had taken her portfolio from under her arm and laid it on his desk.\n",
      "It was a pretty portfolio, bound in powder blue and silver, and was\n",
      "fastened by a powder blue tape with silver tassels.  Bones eyed it with\n",
      "pardonable curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not asking you for money, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Miss Stegg went on in her\n",
      "soft, sweet voice.  \"I think we can raise all the money we want at the\n",
      "bazaar.  But we must have things to sell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see, dear old miss,\" said Bones eagerly.  \"You want a few old\n",
      "clothes?  I've got a couple of suits at home, rather baggy at the\n",
      "knees, dear old thing, but you know what we boys are; we wear 'em until\n",
      "they fall off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The horrified Hamilton returned to the scrutiny of his notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose under-garments, if you will permit the indelicacy, my\n",
      "dear old philanthropist----\"  Bones was going on, when the girl stopped\n",
      "him with a gentle shake of her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Tibbetts, it is awfully kind of you, but we do not want\n",
      "anything like that.  The way we expect to raise a lot of money is by\n",
      "selling the photographs of celebrities,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The photographs of celebrities?\" repeated Bones.  \"But, my dear young\n",
      "miss, I haven't had my photograph taken for years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton gasped.  He might have gasped again at what followed, but for\n",
      "the fact that he had got a little beyond the gasping stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl was untying her portfolio, and now she produced something and\n",
      "laid it on the desk before Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How clever of you to guess!\" she murmured.  \"Yes, it is a portrait of\n",
      "you we want to sell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones stared dumbfounded at a picture of himself--evidently a snapshot\n",
      "taken with a press camera--leaving the building.  And, moreover, it was\n",
      "a flattering picture, for there was a stern frown of resolution on\n",
      "Bones's pictured face, which, for some esoteric reason, pleased him.\n",
      "The picture was mounted rather in than on cardboard, for it was in a\n",
      "sunken mount, and beneath the portrait was a little oblong slip of pale\n",
      "blue paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones gazed and glowed.  Neatly printed above the picture were the\n",
      "words: \"Our Captains of Industry.  III.--Augustus Tibbetts, Esq.\n",
      "(Schemes Limited).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones read this with immense satisfaction.  He wondered who were the\n",
      "two men who could be placed before him, but in his generous mood was\n",
      "prepared to admit that he might come third in the list of London's\n",
      "merchant princes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deuced flattering, dear old thing,\" he murmured.  \"Hamilton, old boy,\n",
      "come and look at this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton crossed to the desk, saw, and wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so bad,\" said Bones, dropping his head to one side and regarding\n",
      "the picture critically.  \"Not at all bad, dear old thing.  You've seen\n",
      "me in that mood, I think, old Ham.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the mood?\" said Hamilton innocently.  \"Indigestion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's have a little light on the subject,\" said Bones.  \"Switch on the\n",
      "expensive old electricity, Ham.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said the girl quickly.  \"I don't think so.  If you saw the\n",
      "picture under the light, you'd probably think it wasn't good enough,\n",
      "and then I should have made my journey in vain.  Spare me that, Mr.\n",
      "Tibbetts!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Tibbetts giggled.  At that moment the Being re-appeared.\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland, chief and only stenographer to the firm of Schemes\n",
      "Limited, and Bones beckoned her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just cast your eye over this, young miss,\" he said.  \"What do you\n",
      "think of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl came round the group, looked at the picture, and nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very nice,\" she said, and then she looked at the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Selling it for a charity,\" said Bones carelessly.  \"Some silly old\n",
      "josser will put it up in his drawing-room, I suppose.  You know, Ham,\n",
      "dear old thing, I never can understand this hero-worship business.  And\n",
      "now, my young and philanthropic collector, what do you want me to do?\n",
      "Give you permission?  It is given.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want you to give me your autograph.  Sign down there,\"--she pointed\n",
      "to a little space beneath the picture--\"and just let me sell it for\n",
      "what I can get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all the pleasure in life,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up his long plumed pen and splashed his characteristic\n",
      "signature in the space indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Miss Marguerite Whitland did a serious thing, an amazingly\n",
      "audacious thing, a thing which filled Bones's heart with horror and\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Bones could lift the blotting pad, her forefinger had dropped\n",
      "upon the signature and had been drawn across, leaving nothing more than\n",
      "an indecipherable smudge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear old typewriter!\" gasped Bones.  \"My dear old miss!  Confound\n",
      "it all!  Hang it all, I say!  Dear old thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can leave this picture, madam----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss,\" murmured Bones from force of habit.  Even in his agitation he\n",
      "could not resist the temptation to interrupt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can leave this picture, Miss Stegg,\" said the girl coolly.  \"Mr.\n",

      "horrible fact that Bones knew nothing about boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "He groaned.  He was always groaning, he thought, and seldom with good\n",
      "reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was in a buying mood.  A week before he had bought _The Weekly\n",
      "Sunspot_, which was \"A Satirical Weekly Review of Human Affairs.\"  The\n",
      "possibilities of that purchase had made Hamilton go hot and moisty.  He\n",
      "had gone home one evening, leaving Bones dictating a leading article\n",

      "the identical moment that Hamilton was buying his ticket for London,\n",

      "refused to meet Bones) with one hand, and holding in the other a cheque\n",

      "\n",
      "A week later, Bones, reading his morning paper, reached and passed,\n",
      "without receiving any very violent impression, the information that Mr.\n",
      "John Siker, the well-known private detective, had died at his residence\n",
      "at Clapham Park.  Bones read the item without interest.  He was looking\n",
      "for bargains--an early morning practice of his because the buying fever\n",
      "was still upon him.\n",

      "\n",
      "He had the firm conviction that all new companies were founded on\n",

      "\n",
      "She smiled up at him--a proceeding which was generally sufficient to\n",
      "throw Bones into a pitiful condition of incoherence.  But this morning\n",
      "it had only the effect of making him close his eyes as though to shut\n",
      "out a vision too radiant to be borne.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Drink!\" said the hurt and astounded Bones.  \"Dear old slanderer!\n",

      "\n",
      "He had written sufficient poetry to make a volume--poems which abounded\n",
      "in such rhymes as \"Marguerite,\" \"Dainty feet,\" \"Sweet,\" \"Hard to beat,\"\n",
      "and the like.  But this she did not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the girl was not only accustomed to these periodical\n",

      "\"It is not a nice letter,\" suggested the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see, dear young head-turner,\" said Bones firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter called him \"Sir,\" and went on to speak of the writer's years\n",

      "vengeance for the \"dishonest squeeze\" of which he had been the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones looked at his secretary anxiously.  The censure of Mr. de Vinne\n",
      "affected him not at all.  The possible disapproval of this lady filled\n",
      "him with dire apprehension.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The girl hesitated and then wrote down: \"Dear Sir.\"\n",

      "unnecessarily, \"t-e-m-p-e-r.\"\n",

      "It was a practice of his to spell simple words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are just showing your naughty temper,\" he went on, \"and I simply\n",

      "\n",
      "The girl wrote: \"Dear Sir,--No useful purpose would be served either in\n",

      "on the circumstances of which you complain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones went back to his office feeling better.  Hamilton left early that\n",
      "afternoon, so that when, just after the girl had said \"Good night,\" and\n",
      "Bones himself was yawning over an evening paper, and there came a rap\n",
      "at the door of the outer office, he was quite alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in!\" he yelled, and a young man, dressed in deep mourning,\n",
      "eventually appeared through the door sacred to the use of Miss\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I've come rather late in the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you have, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"Come and sit down,\n",
      "black one.  Deepest sympathy and all that sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man licked his lips.  His age was about twenty-four, and he\n",
      "had the appearance of being a semi-invalid, as, indeed, he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's rather late to see you on this matter,\" he said, \"but your name\n",
      "was only suggested to me about an hour ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.  Remember that he was always prepared for a miracle, even\n",
      "at closing time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Siker,\" said the visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a jolly good name, too,\" said Bones, dimly conscious of the fact\n",
      "that he had heard this name mentioned before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You probably saw the account of my father's death.  It was in this\n",
      "morning's newspaper, though he died last week,\" said Mr. Siker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones screwed up his forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember that name,\" he said.  \"Now, let me think.  Why, of\n",
      "course--Siker's Detective Agency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the young man's turn to nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right, sir,\" he said.  \"John Siker was my father.  I'm his only\n",
      "son.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've heard it said, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the young man--\"at least, it\n",

      "businesses that show a profit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right,\" agreed Bones; \"that show me a big profit,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Siker's Detective Agency has made two thousand a year clear for\n",
      "twenty years,\" said the young man.  \"We've got one of the best lists of\n",
      "clients in the kingdom, and almost every big business man in the City\n",
      "is on our list.  With a little more attention than my father has been\n",
      "able to give to it for the last two years, there's a fortune in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was sitting upright now, his eyes shining.  The amazing\n",
      "possibilities of such an acquisition were visible to his romantic eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You want to sell it, my poor old Sherlock?\" he demanded, then,\n",
      "remembering the part he was called upon to play, shook his head.  \"No,\n",
      "no, old thing.  Deeply sorry and all that sort of thing, but it can't\n",
      "be done.  It's not my line of business at all--not,\" he added, \"that I\n",
      "don't know a jolly sight more about detectivising than a good many of\n",
      "these clever ones.  But it's really not my game.  What did you want for\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the young man, hesitating, \"I thought that three years'\n",
      "purchase would be a bargain for the man who bought it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six thousand pounds,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" agreed the other.  \"Of course, I won't ask you to buy the thing\n",
      "blindfolded.  You can put the accounts in the hands of your lawyer or\n",
      "your accountant, and you will find that what I have said is true--that\n",
      "my father took two thousand a year out of his business for years.  It's\n",
      "possible to make it four thousand.  And as to running it, there are\n",
      "three men who do all the work--or, rather, one, Hilton, who's in charge\n",
      "of the office and gives the other fellows their instructions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why sell it, my sad old improvidence?\" said Bones.  \"Why chuck\n",
      "away two thousand a year for six thousand cash?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I'm not well enough to carry it on,\" said young Mr. Siker,\n",
      "after a moment's hesitation.  \"And, besides, I can't be bothered.  It\n",
      "interferes, with my other profession--I'm a musician.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a jolly good profession, too,\" said Bones, shaking hands with him\n",
      "across the table.  \"I'll sleep on this.  Give me your address and the\n",
      "address of your accountants, and I'll come over and see you in the\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton was at his desk the next morning at ten o'clock.  Bones did\n",
      "not arrive until eleven, and Bones was monstrously preoccupied.  When\n",
      "Hamilton saluted him with a cheery \"Good morning,\" Bones returned a\n",
      "grave and non-committal nod.  Hamilton went on with his work until he\n",
      "became conscious that somebody was staring at him, and, looking up,\n",
      "caught Bones in the act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the devil are you looking at?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At your boots,\" was the surprising reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boots?\"  Hamilton pulled them back through the kneehole of the desk\n",
      "and looked at them.  \"What's the matter with the boots?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mud-stains, old carelessness,\" said Bones tersely.  \"You've come from\n",
      "Twickenham this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I've come from Twickenham.  That's where I live,\" said\n",
      "Hamilton innocently.  \"I thought you knew that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have known it,\" said Bones, with great gravity, \"even if I\n",
      "hadn't known it, so to speak.  You may have observed, my dear Hamilton,\n",
      "that the jolly old mud of London differs widely--that is to say, is\n",
      "remarkably different.  For instance, the mud of Twickenham is different\n",
      "from the mud of Balham.  There's what you might call a subtle\n",
      "difference, dear junior partner, which an unimaginative old rascal like\n",
      "you wouldn't notice.  Now, the mud of Peckham,\" said Bones, waving his\n",
      "forefinger, \"is distinguished by a certain darkness----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton.  \"Have you bought a mud business or\n",
      "something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet this conversation seems familiar to me,\" mused Hamilton.\n",
      "\"Proceed with your argument, good gossip.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My argument,\" said Bones, \"is that you have Twickenham mud on your\n",
      "boots, therefore you come from Twickenham.  It is evident that on your\n",
      "way to the station you stopped to buy a newspaper, that something was\n",
      "on your mind, something made you very thoughtful--something on your\n",
      "jolly old conscience, I'll bet!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know that?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's your _Times_ on the table,\" said Bones triumphantly,\n",
      "\"unopened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite true,\" said Hamilton; \"I bought it just before I came into the\n",
      "office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm!\" said Bones.  \"Well, I won't deceive you, dear old partner.  I've\n",
      "bought Siker's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton put down his pen and leaned back in his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's Siker's?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Siker's Detective Agency,\" began Bones, \"is known from one end----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I see.  Whew!\" whistled Hamilton.  \"You were doing a bit of\n",
      "detecting!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones smirked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got it at once, my dear old person,\" he said.  \"You know my\n",
      "methods----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton's accusing eye met his, and Bones coughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what on earth do you expect to do with a detective agency, Bones?\"\n",
      "asked Hamilton, strolling across and lighting a cigarette.  \"That's a\n",
      "type of business there isn't any big demand for.  And how is it going\n",
      "to affect you personally?  You don't want your name associated with\n",
      "that sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones explained.  It was a property he could \"sit on.\"  Bones had\n",
      "always been looking for such a business.  The management was capable of\n",
      "carrying on, and all that Bones need do was to sit tight and draw a\n",
      "dividend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to his name, he had found a cunning solution to that difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I take it over, by arrangement with the lawyer in the name of 'Mr.\n",
      "Senob,' and I'll bet you won't guess, dear old Ham, how I got that\n",
      "name!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's 'Bones' spelt backwards,\" said Hamilton patiently.  \"You tried\n",
      "that bit of camouflage on me years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones sniffed disappointedly and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "For once he was logical, brief in his explanation, and convincing.  Yet\n",
      "Hamilton was not altogether convinced.  He was waiting for the\n",
      "inevitable \"but,\" and presently it came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But of course I'm not going to leave it entirely alone, old Ham,\" said\n",
      "Bones, shrugging his shoulders at the absurdity of such a suggestion.\n",
      "\"The business can be doubled if a man with a capable, up-to-date\n",
      "conception of modern crime----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton made a hooting noise, derisive and insulting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meaning you?\" he said, at the conclusion of his lamentable exhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meaning me, Ham, my fat old sceptic,\" said Bones gently.  \"I don't\n",
      "think, dear old officer, you quite realise just what I know about\n",
      "criminal investigation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You silly ass,\" said Hamilton, \"detective agencies don't criminally\n",
      "investigate.  That's done by the real police.  Detective agencies are\n",
      "merely employed by suspicious wives to follow their husbands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Bones, nodding.  \"And that is just where I come in.\n",
      "You see, I did a little bit of work last night--rather a pretty little\n",
      "bit of work.\"  He took a slip of paper from his pocket.  \"You dined at\n",
      "the Criterion at half-past eight with a tall, fair lady--a jolly old\n",
      "dear she was too, old boy, and I congratulate you most heartily--named\n",
      "Vera.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton's face went red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You left the restaurant at ten past nine, and entered cab No. 667432.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to tell me,\" exploded Hamilton, \"that you were watching\n",
      "me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I picked you up, old thing, outside the Piccadilly Tube.  I shadowed\n",
      "you to the theatre.  I followed you home.  You got a taxi--No.\n",
      "297431--and you were an awful long time before you got out when you\n",
      "reached the lady's destination--an awful long time,\" said Bones\n",
      "emphatically.  \"What you could find to talk about after the cab had\n",
      "drawn up at the dear old ancestral home of Vera----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Hamilton awfully.  \"I think you've gone far enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd gone a bit too far, dear old thing, I did really,\"\n",
      "said Bones, shaking his head reprovingly.  \"I watched you very\n",
      "carefully.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He danced, with a little squeak of joy, into the office of his\n",
      "beautiful secretary, leaving a very red and a pardonably annoyed\n",
      "Hamilton breathing heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones went to the office of Siker's Detective Agency early the next\n",
      "morning.  He went, it may be remarked in passing, though these details\n",
      "can only be interesting to the psychologist, wearing the darkest of his\n",
      "dark suits and a large black wideawake hat.  There was a certain\n",
      "furtiveness in his movements between the taxicab and the entrance of\n",
      "the office, which might suggest to anybody who had taken the trouble to\n",
      "observe him that he was an escaping bank-robber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siker's had spacious offices and a small staff.  Only Hilton, the\n",
      "manager, and a clerk were in when Bones presented his card.  He was\n",
      "immediately conducted by Mr. Hilton to a very plain inner office,\n",
      "surrounded with narrow shelves, which in turn were occupied by\n",
      "innumerable little deed boxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hilton was a sober-faced man of fifty-five, sallow and unhappy.\n",
      "His tone was funereal and deliberate, his eyes steady and remorseless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, Mr. Senob,\" he said hollowly.  \"I have a message from the\n",
      "lawyers, and I presume I am welcoming to this establishment the new\n",
      "proprietor who has taken the place of my revered chief, whom I have\n",
      "faithfully served for twenty-nine years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones closed his eyes and listened as to an address of welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Personally,\" said Mr. Hilton, \"I think that the sale of this business\n",
      "is a great mistake on the part of the Siker family.  The Sikers have\n",
      "been detectives for four generations,\" he said with a relish of an\n",
      "antiquarian.  \"George Siker first started work as an investigator in\n",
      "1814 in this identical building.  For thirty-five years he conducted\n",
      "Siker's Confidential Bureau, and was succeeded by his son James the\n",
      "grandfather of the late John George for twenty-three years----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Bones.  \"Poor old George!  Well, well, we\n",
      "can't live for ever, dear old chief of staff.  Now, the thing is, how\n",
      "to improve this jolly old business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked around the dingy apartment without enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones had visitors that morning, many visitors.  They were not, as he\n",
      "had anticipated, veiled ladies or cloaked dukes, nor did they pour into\n",
      "his discreet ears the stories of misspent lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was Mr. Carlo Borker, of Borker's Confidential Enquiry Bureau, a\n",
      "gross man in a top hat, who complained bitterly that old man Siker had\n",
      "practically and to all intents and purposes offered him an option of\n",
      "the business years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a one-sided conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I says to him: 'Siker, if you ever want to sell out' ...  He says to\n",
      "me: 'Borker, my boy, you've only to offer me a reasonable figure' ...\n",
      "I says to him: 'Now, Siker, don't ever let anybody else get this\n",
      "business....'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was ex-Inspector Stellingworth, of Stellingworth's Detective\n",
      "Corps, a gloomy man, who painted in the blackest colours the\n",
      "difficulties and tragedies of private investigation, yet seemed willing\n",
      "enough to assume the burden of Siker's Agency, and give Bones a\n",
      "thousand pounds profit on his transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Augustus Tibbetts spent three deliciously happy days in\n",
      "reorganising the business.  He purchased from the local gunsmith a\n",
      "number of handcuffs, which were festooned upon the wall behind his desk\n",
      "and secured secretly--since he did not think that the melancholy Mr.\n",
      "Hilton would approve--a large cardboard box filled to the brim with\n",
      "adjustable beards of every conceivable hue, from bright scarlet to\n",
      "mouse colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found time to relate to a sceptical Hamilton something of his\n",
      "achievements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wonderful case to-day, dear old boy,\" he said enthusiastically on the\n",
      "third evening.  \"A naughty old lady has been flirting with a very, very\n",
      "naughty old officer.  Husband tremendously annoyed.  How that man loves\n",
      "that woman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which man?\" said Hamilton cynically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I refer to my client,\" said Bones not without dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, Bones,\" said Hamilton with great seriousness, \"do you think\n",
      "this is a very nice business you are in?  Personally, I think it's\n",
      "immoral.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean--immoral?\" demanded the indignant Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prying into other people's lives,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lives,\" retorted the oracular Bones, \"are meant to be pried into, dear\n",
      "old thing.  An examination of jolly old motives is essential to\n",
      "scientific progress.  I feel I am doing a public duty,\" he went on\n",
      "virtuously, \"exposing the naughty, chastising the sinful, and all that\n",
      "sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, honestly,\" said Hamilton persistently, \"do you think it's the\n",
      "game to chase around collecting purely private details about people's\n",
      "goings on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Bones firmly, \"certainly, dear old thing.  It's a\n",
      "public duty.  Never let it be written on the fair pages of Thiggumy\n",
      "that a Tibbetts shrank back when the call of patriotism--all that sort\n",
      "of thing--you know what I mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you're a jolly old dense one,\" said Bones.  \"And let me say here\n",
      "and now\"--he rammed his bony knuckles on the table and withdrew them\n",
      "with an \"Ouch!\" to suck away the pain--\"let me tell you that, as the\n",
      "Latin poet said, '_Ad What's-his name, ad Thiggumy_.'  'Everything\n",
      "human's frightfully interesting'!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones turned up at his detective office the next morning, full of zeal,\n",
      "and Hilton immediately joined him in his private office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we finish one case to-day, I think,\" said Hilton with\n",
      "satisfaction.  \"It has been very hard trailing him, but I got a good\n",
      "man on the job, and here's the record.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He held in his hand a sheaf of papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Bones.  \"Excellent!  I hope we shall bring the\n",
      "malefactor to justice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's not exactly a malefactor,\" demurred Hilton.  \"It is a job we were\n",
      "doing for one of our best clients.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excellent, excellent!\" murmured Bones.  \"And well we've done it, I'm\n",
      "sure.\"  He leant back in his chair and half closed his eyes.  \"Tell me\n",
      "what you have discovered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This man's a bit of a fool in some ways,\" said Hilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which man--the client?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, the fellow we've been trailing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said Bones.  \"Go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In fact, I wonder that Mr. de Vinne bothered about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De Vinne?\" said Bones sitting up.  \"Harold de Vinne, the moneyed one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's him.  He's one of our oldest customers,\" said Hilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" said Bones, this time without any enthusiasm at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, a man did him in the eye,\" explained Mr. Hilton, \"swindled\n",
      "him, and all that sort of thing.  Well, I think we have got enough to\n",
      "make this chap look silly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones politely.  \"What have you got?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it appears,\" said Hilton, \"that this chap is madly in love with\n",
      "his typist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which chap?\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fellow who did Mr. de Vinne in the eye,\" replied the patient Mr.\n",
      "Hilton.  \"He used to be an officer on the West Coast of Africa, and was\n",
      "known as Bones.  His real name is Tibbetts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we've found out all about him,\" continued Hilton.  \"He's got a\n",
      "flat in Jermyn Street, and this girl of his, this typist girl, dines\n",
      "with him.  She's not a bad-looking girl, mind you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones rose to his feet, and there was in his face a terrible look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hilton,\" he said, \"do you mean that you have been shadowing a\n",
      "perfectly innocent man and a charming, lovely old typewriter, that\n",
      "couldn't say 'Goo' to a boose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was pardonably agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to tell me that this office descends to this low practice\n",
      "of prying into the private lives of virtuous gentlemen and typewriters?\n",
      "Shame upon you, Hilton!\"  His voice shook.  \"Give me that report!\"  He\n",
      "thrust the report into the fire.  \"Now call up Mr. Borker, and tell him\n",
      "I want to see him on business, and don't disturb me, because I am\n",
      "writing a letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled a sheet of paper from his stationery rack and wrote\n",
      "furiously.  He hardly stopped to think, he scarcely stopped to spell.\n",
      "His letter was addressed to Mr. de Vinne, and when, on the following\n",
      "day, Mr. Borker took over the business of Siker's Agency, that eminent\n",

      "\n",
      "There were times when Mr. Cresta Morris was called by that name; there\n",
      "were other moments when he was \"Mr. Staleyborn.\"  His wife, a placid\n",
      "and trusting woman, responded to either name, having implicit faith in\n",
      "the many explanations which her husband offered to her, the favourite\n",
      "amongst them being that business men were seldom known by the names\n",
      "they were born with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the eminent firm of drapers Messrs. Lavender & Rosemary were--or\n",
      "was--in private life one Isadore Ruhl, and everybody knew that the\n",
      "maker of Morgan's Superfatted Soap--\"the soap with foam\"--was a certain\n",
      "member of the House of Lords whose name was not Morgan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Staleyborn, or Morris, had a daughter who ran away from home and\n",
      "became the secretary to Augustus Tibbetts, Managing Director of Schemes\n",
      "Limited, and there were odd moments of the day when Mrs. Staleyborn\n",
      "felt vaguely uneasy about her child's future.  She had often, indeed,\n",
      "shed tears between five o'clock in the afternoon and seven o'clock in\n",
      "the evening, which as everybody knows, is the most depressing time of\n",
      "the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was, however, one of those persons who are immensely comforted by\n",
      "the repetition of ancient saws which become almost original every time\n",
      "they are applied, and one of these sayings was \"Everything is for the\n",
      "best.\"  She believed in miracles, and had reason, for she received her\n",
      "weekly allowance from her erratic husband with monotonous regularity\n",
      "every Saturday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a mere digression to point the fact that Mr. Morris was known\n",
      "by many names.  He was called \"Cress,\" and \"Ike,\" and \"Tubby,\" and\n",
      "\"Staley,\" according to the company in which he found himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening in June he found himself in the society of friends who\n",
      "called him by names which, if they were not strictly original, were\n",
      "certainly picturesque.  One of these companions was a Mr. Webber, who\n",
      "had worked more swindles with Morris than had any other partner, and\n",
      "the third, and most talkative, was a gentleman named Seepidge, of\n",
      "Seepidge & Soomes, printers to the trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Seepidge was a man of forty-five, with a well-used face.  It was\n",
      "one of those faces which look different from any other angle than that\n",
      "from which it is originally seen.  It may be said, too, that his\n",
      "colouring was various.  As he addressed Mr. Morris, it varied between\n",
      "purple and blue.  Mrs. Morris was in the habit of addressing her\n",
      "husband by endearing titles.  Mr. Seepidge was not addressing Mr.\n",
      "Morris in a way which, by any stretch of imagination, could be\n",
      "described as endearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a bit, Lew,\" pleaded Mr. Morris.  \"Don't let's quarrel.\n",
      "Accidents will occur in the best of regulated families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which you're not,\" said the explosive Mr. Seepidge, violently.  \"I\n",
      "gave you two hundred to back Morning Glory in the three o'clock race.\n",
      "You go down to Newbury with my money, and you come back and tell me,\n",
      "after the horse has won, that you couldn't get a bookmaker to take the\n",
      "bet!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I give you the money back,\" replied Mr. Morris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did,\" reported Mr. Seepidge meaningly, \"and I was surprised to\n",
      "find there wasn't a dud note in the parcel.  No, Ike, you\n",
      "double-crossed me.  You backed the horse and took the winnings, and\n",
      "come back to me with a cock-and-bull story about not being able to find\n",
      "a bookmaker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Morris turned a pained face to his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jim,\" he said, addressing Mr. Webber, \"did you ever in all your born\n",
      "days hear a pal put it across another pal like that?  After the work\n",
      "we've done all these years together, me and Lew--why, you're like a\n",
      "serpent in the bush, you are really!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time, and there was much passing of glasses across a\n",
      "lead-covered bar, before Mr. Seepidge could be pacified--the meeting\n",
      "took place in the private bar of \"The Bread and Cheese,\" Camden\n",
      "Town--but presently he turned from the reproachful into the melancholy\n",
      "stage, explained the bad condition of business, what with the paper\n",
      "bills and wages bills he had to pay, and hinted ominously at bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, the firm of Seepidge was in a bad way.  The police had\n",
      "recently raided the premises and nipped in the bud a very promising\n",
      "order for five hundred thousand sweepstake tickets, which were being\n",
      "printed surreptitiously, for Mr. Seepidge dealt in what is colloquially\n",
      "known as \"snide printing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Mr. Cresta Morris had indeed swindled his partner of many\n",
      "crimes, and had backed Morning Glory at a remunerative price for his\n",
      "own profit, is a painful question which need not be too closely\n",
      "examined.  It is certain that Seepidge was in a bad way, and as Mr.\n",
      "Morris told himself with admirable philosophy, even if he had won a\n",
      "packet of money, a thousand or so would not have been sufficient to get\n",
      "Mr. Seepidge out of the cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something has got to be done,\" said Mr. Cresta Morris briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Somebody,\" corrected the taciturn Webber.  \"The question is, who?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you, boys, I'm in a pretty bad way,\" said Seepidge earnestly.\n",
      "\"I don't think, even if I'd backed that winner, I could have got out of\n",
      "trouble.  The business is practically in pawn; I'm getting a police\n",
      "inspection once a week.  I've got a job now which may save my bacon, if\n",
      "I can dodge the 'splits'--an order for a million leaflets for a Hamburg\n",
      "lottery house.  And I want the money--bad!  I owe about three thousand\n",
      "pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know where there's money for asking,\" said Webber, and they looked\n",
      "at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His interesting disclosure was not to follow immediately, for they had\n",
      "reached closing-time, and were respectfully ushered into the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come over to my club,\" said Mr. Seepidge.\n",
      "\n",
      "His club was off the Tottenham Court Road, and its membership was\n",
      "artistic.  It had changed its name after every raid that had been made\n",
      "upon it, and the fact that the people arrested had described themselves\n",
      "as artists and actresses consolidated the New Napoli Club as one of the\n",
      "artistic institutions of London.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, where's this money?\" asked Seepidge, when they were seated round\n",
      "a little table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a fellow called Bones----\" began Mr. Webber.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, him!\" interrupted Mr. Morris, in disgust.  \"Good Heavens!  You're\n",
      "not going to try him again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd have got him before if you hadn't been so clever,\" said Webber.\n",
      "\"I tell you, he's rolling in money.  He's just moved into a new flat in\n",
      "Devonshire Street that can't cost him less than six hundred a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know this?\" asked the interested Morris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" confessed Webber, without embarrassment, \"I've been working\n",
      "solo on him, and I thought I'd be able to pull the job off myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a bit selfish,\" reproached Morris, shaking his head.  \"I didn't\n",
      "expect this from you, Webbie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind what you expected,\" said Webber, unperturbed.  \"I tell you\n",
      "I tried it.  I've been nosing round his place, getting information from\n",
      "his servants, and I've learned a lot about him.  Mind you,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Webber, \"I'm not quite certain how to use what I know to make money.\n",
      "If I'd known that, I shouldn't have told you two chaps anything about\n",
      "it.  But I've got an idea that this chap Bones is a bit sensitive on a\n",
      "certain matter, and Cully Tring, who's forgotten more about human men\n",
      "than I ever knew, told me that, if you can get a mug on his sensitive\n",
      "spot, you can bleed him to death.  Now, three heads are better than\n",
      "one, and I think, if we get together, we'll lift enough stuff from Mr.\n",
      "Blinking Bones to keep us at Monte Carlo for six months.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said Mr. Seepidge impressively, \"let us put our 'eads together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In emotional moments that enterprising printer was apt to overlook the\n",
      "box where the little \"h's\" were kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones had indeed moved into the intellectual atmosphere of Devonshire\n",
      "Street.  He had hired a flat of great beauty and magnificence, with\n",
      "lofty rooms and distempered walls and marble chimney-pieces, for all\n",
      "the world like those rooms in the catalogues of furniture dealers which\n",
      "so admirably show off the fifty-pound drawing-room suite offered on the\n",
      "easiest terms.\n",

      "be cheap, dear old comic one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question is,\" said Hamilton, \"why the dickens do you want a new\n",
      "flat?  Your old flat was quite a palatial establishment.  Are you\n",
      "thinking of setting up housekeeping?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones turned very red.  In his embarrassment he stood first upon one\n",
      "leg and then the other, lifting his eyebrows almost to the roof of his\n",
      "head to let in his monocle, and lifted them as violently to let it out\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't pry, don't pry, dear old Ham,\" he said testily.  \"Great Heavens\n",
      "and Moses!  Can't a fellow take a desirable flat, with all modern\n",
      "conveniences, in the most fashionable part of the West End, and all\n",
      "that sort of thing, without exciting the voice of scandal, dear old\n",
      "thing?  I'm surprised at you, really I am, Ham.  I am, Ham,\" he\n",
      "repeated.  \"That sounds good,\" he said, brightening up.  \"Am Ham!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what is the scheme?\" persisted Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A bargain, a bargain, dear old officer,\" said Bones, hurriedly, and\n",
      "proceeded to the next business.\n",
      "\n",
      "That next business included the rejection of several very promising\n",
      "offers which had arrived from different directors of companies, and\n",
      "people.  Bones was known as a financier.  People who wanted other\n",
      "people to put money into things invariably left Bones to the last,\n",
      "because they liked trying the hard things first.  The inventor and\n",
      "patentee of the reaping machine that could be worked by the farmer in\n",
      "his study, by means of push keys, was sure, sooner or later, to meet a\n",
      "man who scratched his chin and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hard luck, but why don't you try that man Tibbetts?  He's got an\n",
      "office somewhere around.  You'll find it in the telephone book.  He's\n",
      "got more money than he knows what to do with, and your invention is the\n",
      "very thing he'd finance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule, it was the very thing that Bones did not finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies that required ten thousand pounds for the extension of their\n",
      "premises, and the fulfilment of the orders which were certain to come\n",
      "next year, drafted through their secretaries the most wonderful\n",
      "letters, offering Bones a seat on their board, or even two seats, in\n",
      "exchange for his autograph on the south-east corner of a cheque.  These\n",
      "letters usually began somehow like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At a moment when the eyes of the world are turned upon Great Britain,\n",
      "and when her commercial supremacy is threatened, it behoves us all to\n",
      "increase production....\"  And usually there was some reference to \"the\n",
      "patriotic duty of capital.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a time when these appeals to his better nature would have\n",
      "moved Bones to amazing extravagance, but happily that time was before\n",
      "he had any money to speak about.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bones was growing in wisdom and in wiliness as the days passed.\n",
      "Going through the pile of correspondence, he came upon a letter which\n",
      "he read thoughtfully, and then read again before he reached to the\n",
      "telephone and called a number.  In the City of London there was a\n",
      "business-like agency which supplied him with a great deal of useful\n",
      "information, and it was to these gentlemen that he addressed his query:\n",
      "\"Who are Messrs. Seepidge & Soomes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited for some time with the receiver at his ear, a far-away look\n",
      "in his eyes, and then the reply came:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little firm of printers run by a rascal named Seepidge, who has been\n",
      "twice bankrupt and is now insolvent.  His firm has been visited by the\n",
      "police for illegal printing several times, and the firm is in such a\n",
      "low condition that it has a job to pay its wages bill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bones.  \"Thank you, dear old commercial guardian.\n",
      "What is the business worth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's worth your while to keep away from it,\" said the humorous reply,\n",
      "and Bones hung up the receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ham, old dear,\" he said, and Hamilton looked up.  \"Suppose,\" said\n",
      "Bones, stretching out his legs and fixing his monocle, \"suppose, my\n",
      "jolly old accountant and partner, you were offered a business which was\n",
      "worth\"--he paused--\"which was worth your while keeping away from\n",
      "it--that's a pretty good line, don't you think, old literary critic?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very good line,\" said Hamilton calmly; \"but you have rather a\n",
      "loud-speaking telephone, and I think I have heard the phrase before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, have you?\" said Bones by no means abashed.  \"Still, it's a very\n",
      "good line.  And suppose you were offered this printing business for\n",
      "fifteen thousand pounds, what would you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It depends on who was present,\" said Ham, \"and where I was.  For\n",
      "example, if I were in the gorgeous drawing-room of your wonderful flat,\n",
      "in the splendid presence of your lovely lady wife to be----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones rose and wagged his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is nothing sacred to you, dear old Ham?\" he choked.  \"Are the most\n",
      "tender emotions, dear old thing, which have ever been experienced by\n",
      "any human being----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hamilton, \"and let's hear about this financial\n",
      "problem of yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was ruffled, and blinked, and it was some time before he could\n",
      "bring himself back to sordid matters of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, suppose this jolly old brigand offered you his perfectly beastly\n",
      "business for fifteen thousand pounds, what would you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send for the police,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you now?\" said Bones, as if the idea struck him for the first\n",
      "time.  \"I never have sent for the police you know, and I've had simply\n",
      "terrible offers put up to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or put it in the waste-paper basket,\" said Hamilton, and then in\n",
      "surprise: \"Why the dickens are you asking all these questions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why am I asking all these questions?\" repeated Bones.  \"Because, old\n",
      "thing, I have a hump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton raised incredulous eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have what the Americans call a hump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A hump?\" said Hamilton, puzzled.  \"Oh, you mean a 'hunch.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hump or hunch, it's all the same,\" said Bones airily.  \"But I've got\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What exactly is your hunch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's something behind this,\" said Bones, tapping a finger solemnly\n",
      "on the desk.  \"There's a scheme behind this--there's a swindle--there's\n",
      "a ramp.  Nobody imagines for one moment that a man of my reputation\n",
      "could be taken in by a barefaced swindle of this character.  I think I\n",
      "have established in the City of London something of a tradition,\" he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have,\" agreed Hamilton.  \"You're supposed to be the luckiest devil\n",
      "that ever walked up Broad Street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never walk up Broad Street, anyway,\" said Bones, annoyed.  \"It is a\n",
      "detestable street, a naughty old street, and I should ride up it--or,\n",
      "at least, I shall in a day or two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Buying a car?\" asked Hamilton, interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you about that later,\" said Bones evasively, and went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, putting two and two together, you know the conclusion I've\n",
      "reached?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four?\" suggested Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, with a shrug ended the conversation then and there, and carried\n",
      "his correspondence to the outer office, knocking, as was his wont,\n",
      "until his stenographer gave him permission to enter.  He shut the\n",
      "door--always a ceremony--behind him and tiptoed toward her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland took her mind from the letter she was writing, and\n",
      "gave her full attention to her employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I sit down, dear young typewriter?\" said Bones humbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you can sit down, or stand up, or do anything you like in\n",
      "the office.  Really,\" she said, with a laugh, \"really, Mr. Tibbetts, I\n",
      "don't know whether you're serious sometimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm serious all the time, dear old flicker of keyboards,\" said Bones,\n",
      "seating himself deferentially, and at a respectful distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for him to begin, but he was strangely embarrassed even for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Marguerite,\" he began at last a little huskily, \"the jolly old\n",
      "poet is born and not----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, have you brought them?\" she asked eagerly, and held out her hand.\n",
      "\"Do show me, please!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I have not brought them,\" he said.  \"In fact, I can't bring them\n",
      "yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was disappointed, and showed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've promised me for a week I should see them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful stuff, awful stuff!\" murmured Bones disparagingly.  \"Simply\n",
      "terrible tripe!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tripe?\" she said, puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean naughty rubbish and all that sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I'm sure it's good,\" she said.  \"You wouldn't talk about your\n",
      "poems if they weren't good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" admitted Bones, \"I'm not so sure, dear old arbitrator\n",
      "elegantus, to use a Roman expression, I'm not so sure you're not right.\n",
      "One of these days those poems will be given to this wicked old world,\n",
      "and--then you'll see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what are they all about?\" she asked for about the twentieth time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are they about?\" said Bones slowly and thoughtfully.  \"They're\n",
      "about one thing and another, but mostly about my--er--friends.  Of\n",
      "course a jolly old poet like me, or like any other old fellow, like\n",
      "Shakespeare, if you like--to go from the sublime to the ridiculous--has\n",
      "fits of poetising that mean absolutely nothing.  It doesn't follow that\n",
      "if a poet like Browning or me writes fearfully enthusiastically and all\n",
      "that sort of thing about a person...  No disrespect, you understand,\n",
      "dear old miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite,\" she said, and wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I take a subject for a verse,\" said Bones airily, waving his hand\n",
      "toward Throgmorton Street.  \"A 'bus, a fuss, a tram, a lamb, a hat, a\n",
      "cat, a sunset, a little flower growing on the river's brim, and all\n",
      "that sort of thing--any old subject, dear old miss, that strikes me in\n",
      "the eye--you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I understand,\" she said readily.  \"A poet's field is\n",
      "universal, and I quite understand that if he writes nice things about\n",
      "his friends he doesn't mean it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but doesn't he?\" said Bones truculently.  \"Oh, doesn't he, indeed?\n",
      "That just shows what a fat lot you know about it, jolly old Miss\n",
      "Marguerite.  When I write a poem about a girl----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I see, they're about girls,\" said she a little coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About _a_ girl,\" said Bones, this time so pointedly that his confusion\n",
      "was transferred immediately to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyway, they don't mean anything,\" she said bravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear young miss\"--Bones rose, and his voice trembled as he laid his\n",
      "hand on the typewriter where hers had been a second before--\"my dear\n",
      "old miss,\" he said, jingling with the letters \"a\" and \"e\" as though he\n",
      "had originally put out his hand to touch the keyboard, and was in no\n",
      "way surprised and distressed that the little hand which had covered\n",
      "them had been so hastily withdrawn, \"I can only tell you----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is your telephone bell,\" she said hurriedly.  \"Shall I answer\n",
      "it?\"  And before Bones could reply she had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went back to his flat that night with his mind made up.  He would\n",
      "show her those beautiful verses.  He had come to this conclusion many\n",
      "times before, but his heart had failed him.  But he was growing\n",
      "reckless now.  She should see them--priceless verses, written in a most\n",
      "expensive book, with the monogram \"W.M.\" stamped in gold upon the\n",
      "cover.  And as he footed it briskly up Devonshire Street, he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"O Marguerite, thou lovely flower,\n",
      "  I think of thee most every hour,\n",
      "  With eyes of grey and eyes of blue,\n",
      "  That change with every passing hue,\n",
      "  Thy lovely fingers beautifully typing,\n",
      "  How sweet and fragrant is thy writing!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he was reciting to himself, but that was not the case.\n",
      "People turned and watched him, and when he passed the green doorway of\n",
      "Dr. Harkley Bawkley, the eminent brain specialist, they were visibly\n",
      "disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not unlock the rosewood door of his flat, but rang the silver\n",
      "bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "He preferred this course.  Ali, his Coast servant, in his new livery of\n",
      "blue and silver, made the opening of the door something only less\n",
      "picturesque than the opening of Parliament.  This intention may not\n",
      "have been unconnected with the fact that there were two or three young\n",
      "ladies, and very young at that, on the landing, waiting for the door of\n",
      "the opposite flat to open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali opened the door.  The lower half of him was blue and silver, the\n",
      "upper half was Oxford shirt and braces, for he had been engaged in\n",
      "cleaning the silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the deuce do you mean by it?\" demanded Bones wrathfully.\n",
      "\"Haven't I given you a good uniform, you blithering jackass?  What the\n",
      "deuce do you mean by opening the door, in front of people, too, dressed\n",
      "like a--a--dashed naughty boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silverous forks require lubrication for evening repast,\" said Ali\n",
      "reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones stalked on to his study.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lovely study, with a carpet of beautiful blue.  It was a study\n",
      "of which a man might be proud.  The hangings were of silk, and the\n",
      "suite was also of silk, and also of blue silk.  He sat down at his\n",
      "Louis XVI. table, took a virgin pad, and began to write.  The\n",
      "inspiration was upon him, and he worked at top speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw a litle bird--a litle bird--a litle bird, floating in the sky,\"\n",
      "he wrote.  \"Ever so high!  Its pretty song came down, down to me, and\n",
      "it sounded like your voice the other afternoon at tea, at tea.  And in\n",
      "its flite I remembered the night when you came home to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused at the last, because Marguerite Whitland had never come home\n",
      "to him, certainly not at night.  The proprieties had to be observed,\n",
      "and he changed the last few lines to: \"I remember the day when you came\n",
      "away to Margate on the sea, on the sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not seen his book of poems for a week, but there was a blank\n",
      "page at the end into which the last, and possibly the greatest, might\n",
      "go.  He pulled the drawer open.  It was empty.  There was no mistaking\n",
      "the fact that that had been the drawer in which the poems had reposed,\n",
      "because Bones had a very excellent memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rang the bell and Ali came, his Oxford shirt and braces imperfectly\n",
      "hidden under a jersey which had seen better days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ali\"--and this time Bones spoke rapidly and in Coast Arabic--\"in this\n",
      "drawer was a beautiful book in which I had written many things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master, that I know, for you are a great poet, and I speak your\n",
      "praises whenever I go into the _café_, for Hafiz did not write more\n",
      "beautifully than you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the dooce,\" spluttered Bones in English, \"do you mean by telling\n",
      "people about me--eh, you scoundrel?  What the dooce do you mean by it,\n",
      "you naughty old ebony?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master,\" said All \"eulogistic speechification creates admiration in\n",
      "common minds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so unruffled, so complacent, that Bones, could only look at him\n",
      "in wonder.  There was, too, about Ali Mahomet a queer look of guilty\n",
      "satisfaction, as of one who had been surprised in a good act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master,\" he said, \"it is true that, contrary to modest desires of\n",
      "humble poets, I have offered praises of your literature to unauthorised\n",
      "persons, sojourning in high-class _café_ 'King's Arms,' for my evening\n",
      "refreshment.  Also desiring to create pleasant pleasure and surprise,\n",
      "your servant from his own emoluments authorised preparation of said\n",
      "poems in real print work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were going to get my things printed?  Oh, you ... oh, you....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali was by no means distressed.\n",

      "\"To-morrow there shall come to you a beautiful book for the master's\n",
      "surprise and joyousness.  I myself will settle account satisfactorily\n",
      "from emoluments accrued.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones could only sit down and helplessly wag his head.  Presently he\n",
      "grew calmer.  It was a kindly thought, after all.  Sooner or later\n",
      "those poems of his must be offered to the appreciation of a larger\n",
      "audience.  He saw blind Fate working through his servitor's act.  The\n",
      "matter had been taken out of his hands now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What made you do it, you silly old josser?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Master, one gentleman friend suggested or proffered advice, himself\n",

      "\n",
      "A horrible thought came into Bones's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was his name?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali fumbled in the capacious depths of his trousers pocket and produced\n",
      "a soiled card, which he handed to Bones.  Bones read with a groan:\n",
      "\n",
      "  MESSRS. SEEPIDGE & SOOMES,\n",
      "    Printers to the Trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones fell back in the padded depths of his writing chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, you've done it,\" he said hollowly, and threw the card back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell behind Ali, and he turned his back on Bones and stooped to pick\n",
      "up the card.  It was a target which, in Bones's then agitated\n",

      "thought--they were unmistakably disrespectful to Miss Marguerite\n",
      "Whitland!  They were love poems.  They declared Bones's passion in\n",
      "language which was unmistakable.  They told of her hair which was\n",
      "beyond compare, of her eyes which rivalled the skies, and of her lips\n",
      "like scarlet strips.  Bones bowed his head in his hands, and was in\n",
      "this attitude when the door opened, and Miss Whitland, who had had a\n",
      "perfect night and looked so lovely that her poems became pallid and\n",
      "nauseating caricatures, stepped quietly into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you well, Mr. Tibbetts?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, quite well,\" said Bones valiantly.  \"Very tra-la-la, dear old\n",
      "thing, dear old typewriter, I mean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that correspondence for me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She held out her hand, and Bones hastily thrust Messrs. Seepidge &\n",
      "Soomes's letter, with its enclosure, into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, yes, yes,\" he said incoherently.  \"Certainly why not this is a\n",
      "letter dear old thing about a patent medicine I have just taken I am\n",
      "not all I was a few years ago old age is creeping on me and all that\n",
      "sort of stuff shut the door as you go in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said this without a comma or a full-stop.  He said it so wildly that\n",
      "she was really alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton arrived a little later, and to him Bones made full confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's see the poems,\" said Hamilton seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't laugh?\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be an ass.  Of course I won't laugh, unless they're supposed to\n",
      "be comic,\" said Hamilton.  And, to do him justice, he did not so much\n",
      "as twitch a lip, though Bones watched his face jealously.\n",
      "\n",
      "So imperturbable was Hamilton's expression that Bones had courage to\n",
      "demand with a certain smugness:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, old man, not so bad?  Of course, they don't come up to Kipling,\n",
      "but I can't say that I'm fearfully keen on Kipling, old thing.  That\n",
      "little one about the sunset, I think, is rather a gem.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you're rather a gem,\" said Hamilton, handing back the proofs.\n",
      "\"Bones, you've behaved abominably, writing poetry of that kind and\n",
      "leaving it about.  You're going to make this girl the laughing-stock of\n",
      "London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laughing-stock?\" snorted the annoyed Bones.  \"What the dickens do you\n",
      "mean, old thing?  I told you there are no comic poems.  They're all\n",
      "like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid they were,\" said Hamilton.  \"But poems needn't be comic,\"\n",
      "he added a little more tactfully, as he saw Bones's colour rising,\n",
      "\"they needn't be comic to excite people's amusement.  The most solemn\n",
      "and sacred things, the most beautiful thoughts, the most wonderful\n",
      "sentiments, rouse the laughter of the ignorant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, true,\" agreed Bones graciously.  \"And I rather fancy that they\n",
      "are a little bit on the most beautiful side, my jolly old graven image.\n",
      "All heart outpourings you understand--but no, you wouldn't understand,\n",
      "my old crochety one.  One of these days, as I've remarked before, they\n",
      "will be read by competent judges ... midnight oil, dear old thing--at\n",
      "least, I have electric light in my flat.  They're generally done after\n",
      "dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After a heavy dinner, I should imagine,\" said Hamilton with asperity.\n",
      "\"What are you going to do about it, Bones?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones scratched his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm blessed if I know,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell you what you must do?\" asked Hamilton quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, Ham, my wise old counsellor,\" said the cheerful Bones.\n",
      "\"Certainly, by all means, Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must go to Miss Whitland and tell her all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones's face fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heavens, no!\" he gasped.  \"Don't be indelicate, Ham!  Why, she\n",
      "might never forgive me, dear old thing!  Suppose she walked out of the\n",
      "office in a huff?  Great Scotland!  Great Jehoshaphat!  It's too\n",
      "terrible to contemplate!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must tell her,\" said Hamilton firmly.  \"It's only fair to the girl\n",
      "to know exactly what is hanging over her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones pleaded, and offered a hundred rapid solutions, none of which\n",
      "were acceptable to the relentless Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell her myself, if you like,\" he said.  \"I could explain that\n",
      "they're just the sort of things that a silly ass of a man does, and\n",
      "that they were not intended to be offensive--even that one about her\n",
      "lips being like two red strips.  Strips of what--carpet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't analyse it, Ham, lad, don't analyse it!\" begged Bones.  \"Poems\n",
      "are like pictures, old friend.  You want to stand at a distance to see\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Personally I suffer from astigmatism,\" said Hamilton, and read the\n",
      "poems again.  He stopped once or twice to ask such pointed questions as\n",
      "how many \"y's\" were in \"skies,\" and Bones stood on alternate feet,\n",
      "protesting incoherently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're not bad, old boy?\" he asked anxiously at last.  \"You wouldn't\n",
      "say they were bad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad,\" said Hamilton in truth, \"is not the word I should apply.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones cheered up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I think, dear ex-officer,\" he smirked.  \"Of course, a\n",
      "fellow is naturally shy about maiden efforts, and all that sort of\n",
      "thing, but, hang it all, I've seen worse than that last poem, old\n",
      "thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So have I,\" admitted Hamilton, mechanically turning back to the first\n",
      "poem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all\"--Bones was rapidly becoming philosophical--\"I'm not so sure\n",
      "that it isn't the best thing that could happen.  Let 'em print 'em!\n",
      "Hey?  What do you say?  Put that one about young Miss Marguerite being\n",
      "like a pearl discovered in a dustbin, dear Ham, put it before a\n",
      "competent judge, and what would he say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ten years,\" snarled Hamilton, \"and you'd get off lightly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones smiled with admirable toleration, and there the matter ended for\n",
      "the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a case of blackmail, as Hamilton had pointed out, but, as the\n",
      "day proceeded, Bones took a more and more lenient view of his enemy's\n",
      "fault.  By the afternoon he was cheerful, even jocose, and, even in\n",
      "such moments as he found himself alone with the girl, brought the\n",
      "conversation round to the subject of poetry as one of the fine arts,\n",
      "and cunningly excited her curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is so much bad poetry in the world,\" said the girl on one such\n",
      "occasion, \"that I think there should be a lethal chamber for people who\n",
      "write it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agreed, dear old tick-tack,\" assented Bones, with an amused smile.\n",
      "\"What is wanted is--well, I know, dear old miss.  It may surprise you\n",
      "to learn that I once took a correspondence course in poetry writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing surprises me about you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" she laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went into her office before leaving that night.  Hamilton, with a\n",
      "gloomy shake of his head by way of farewell, had already departed, and\n",
      "Bones, who had given the matter very considerable thought, decided that\n",
      "this was a favourable occasion to inform her of the amusing efforts of\n",
      "his printer correspondent to extract money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl had finished her work, her typewriter was covered, and she was\n",
      "wearing her hat and coat.  But she sat before her desk, a frown on her\n",
      "pretty face and an evening newspaper in her hand, and Bones's heart\n",
      "momentarily sank.  Suppose the poems had been given to the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the winners, dear old miss?\" he asked, with spurious gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up with a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she said.  \"I'm rather worried, Mr. Tibbetts.  A friend of my\n",
      "step-father's has got into trouble again, and I'm anxious lest my\n",
      "mother should have any trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear!\" said the sympathetic Bones.  \"How disgustingly annoying!\n",
      "Who's the dear old friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man named Seepidge,\" said the girl, and Bones gripped a chair for\n",
      "support.  \"The police have found that he is printing something illegal.\n",
      "I don't quite understand it all, but the things they were printing were\n",
      "invitations to a German lottery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very naughty, very unpatriotic,\" murmured the palpitating Bones, and\n",
      "then the girl laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has its funny side,\" she said.  \"Mr. Seepidge pretended that he was\n",
      "carrying out a legitimate order--a book of poems.  Isn't that absurd?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" said Bones hollowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen,\" said the girl, and read:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The magistrate, in sentencing Seepidge to six months' hard labour,\n",
      "said that there was no doubt that the man had been carrying on an\n",
      "illegal business.  He had had the effrontery to pretend that he was\n",
      "printing a volume of verse.  The court had heard extracts from that\n",
      "precious volume, which had evidently been written by Mr. Seepidge's\n",
      "office-boy.  He had never read such appalling drivel in his life.  He\n",
      "ordered the confiscated lottery prospectuses to be destroyed, and he\n",
      "thought he would be rendering a service to humanity if he added an\n",
      "order for the destruction of this collection of doggerel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl looked up at Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is curious that we should have been talking about poetry to-day,\n",
      "isn't it?\" she asked.  \"Now, Mr. Tibbetts, I'm going to insist upon\n",
      "your bringing that book of yours to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, very flushed of face, shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old disciple,\" he said huskily, \"another time ... another time\n",
      "... poetry should be kept for years ... like old wine...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who said that?\" she asked, folding her paper and rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Competent judges,\" said Bones, with a gulp.\n",

      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "\n",
      "THE LAMP THAT NEVER WENT OUT\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you seen her?\" asked Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put this question with such laboured unconcern that Hamilton put\n",
      "down his pen and glared suspiciously at his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's rather a beauty,\" Bones went on, toying with his ivory\n",
      "paper-knife.  \"She has one of those dinky bonnets, dear old thing, that\n",
      "makes you feel awfully braced with life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton gasped.  He had seen the beautiful Miss Whitland enter the\n",
      "office half an hour before, but he had not noticed her head-dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her body's dark blue, with teeny red stripes,\" said Bones dreamily,\n",
      "\"and all her fittings are nickel-plated----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" commanded Hamilton hollowly.  \"To what unhappy woman are you\n",
      "referring in this ribald fashion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Woman!\" spluttered the indignant Bones.  \"I'm talking about my car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your car?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My car,\" said Bones, in the off-handed way that a sudden millionaire\n",
      "might refer to \"my earth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've bought a car?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a jolly good 'bus,\" he said.  \"I thought of running down to\n",
      "Brighton on Sunday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton got up and walked slowly across the room with his hands in his\n",
      "pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're thinking of running down to Brighton, are you?\" he said.  \"Is\n",
      "it one of those kind of cars where you have to do your own running?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, with a good-natured smile, also rose from his desk and walked to\n",
      "the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My car,\" he said, and waved his hand to the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "By craning his neck, Hamilton was able to get a view of the patch of\n",
      "roadway immediately in front of the main entrance to the building.  And\n",
      "undoubtedly there was a car in waiting--a long, resplendent machine\n",
      "that glittered in the morning sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the pink cushion on the seat?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not a pink cushion, dear old myoptic,\" said Bones calmly;\n",
      "\"that's my chauffeur--Ali ben Ahmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good lor!\" said the impressed Hamilton.  \"You've a nerve to drive into\n",
      "the City with a sky-blue Kroo boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We attracted a certain amount of attention,\" he admitted, not without\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally,\" said Hamilton, going back to his desk.  \"People thought\n",
      "you were advertising Pill Pellets for Pale Poultry.  When did you buy\n",
      "this infernal machine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, at his desk, crossed his legs and put his fingers together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Negotiations, dear old Ham, have been in progress for a month,\" he\n",
      "recited.  \"I have been taking lessons on the quiet, and to-day--proof!\"\n",
      "He took out his pocket-book and threw a paper with a lordly air towards\n",
      "his partner.  It fell half-way on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't trouble to get up,\" said Hamilton.  \"It's your motor licence.\n",
      "You needn't be able to drive a car to get that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Bones dropped his attitude of insouciance and became a\n",
      "vociferous advertisement for the six-cylinder Carter-Crispley (\"the big\n",
      "car that's made like a clock\").  He became double pages with\n",
      "illustrations and handbooks and electric signs.  He spoke of Carter and\n",
      "of Crispley individually and collectively with enthusiasm, affection,\n",
      "and reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Hamilton, when he had finished.  \"It sounds good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sounds good!\" scoffed Bones.  \"Dear old sceptical one, that car...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "All excesses being their own punishment, two days later Bones renewed\n",
      "an undesirable acquaintance.  In the early days of Schemes, Ltd., Mr.\n",
      "Augustus Tibbetts had purchased a small weekly newspaper called the\n",
      "_Flame_.  Apart from the losses he incurred during its short career,\n",
      "the experience was made remarkable by the fact that he became\n",
      "acquainted with Mr. Jelf, a young and immensely self-satisfied man in\n",
      "pince-nez, who habitually spoke uncharitably of bishops, and never\n",
      "referred to members of the Government without causing sensitive people\n",
      "to shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The members of the Government retaliated by never speaking of Jelf at\n",
      "all, so there was probably some purely private feud between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jelf disapproved of everything.  He was twenty-four years of age, and\n",
      "he, too, had made the acquaintance of the Hindenburg Line.  Naturally\n",
      "Bones thought of Jelf when he purchased the _Flame_.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the first Bones had run the _Flame_ with the object of exposing\n",
      "things.  He exposed Germans, Swedes, and Turks--which was safe.  He\n",
      "exposed a furniture dealer who had made him pay twice for an article\n",
      "because a receipt was lost, and that cost money.  He exposed a man who\n",
      "had been very rude to him in the City.  He would have exposed James\n",
      "Jacobus Jelf, only that individual showed such eagerness to expose his\n",
      "own shortcomings, at a guinea a column, that Bones had lost interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "His stock of personal grievances being exhausted, he had gone in for a\n",
      "general line of exposure which embraced members of the aristocracy and\n",
      "the Stock Exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Bones did not like a man's face, he exposed him.  He had a column\n",
      "headed \"What I Want to Know,\" and signed \"Senob.\"  in which such\n",
      "pertinent queries appeared as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When will the naughty old lord who owns a sky-blue motor-car, and\n",
      "wears pink spats, realise that his treatment of his tenants is a\n",
      "disgrace to his ancient lineage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was one of James Jacobus Jelf's contributed efforts.  It happened\n",
      "on this particular occasion that there was only one lord in England who\n",
      "owned a sky-blue car and blush-rose spats, and it cost Bones two\n",
      "hundred pounds to settle his lordship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this, Bones disposed of the paper, and instructed Mr. Jelf\n",
      "not to call again unless he called in an ambulance--an instruction\n",
      "which afterwards filled him with apprehension, since he knew that J. J.\n",
      "J. would charge up the ambulance to the office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus matters stood two days after his car had made its public\n",
      "appearance, and Bones sat confronting the busy pages of his garage bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this day he had had his lunch brought into the office, and he was in\n",
      "a maze of calculation, when there came a knock at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in!\" he yelled, and, as there was no answer, walked to the door\n",
      "and opened it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A young man stood in the doorway--a young man very earnest and very\n",
      "mysterious--none other than James Jacobus Jelf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said Bones unfavourably \"I thought it was\n",
      "somebody important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jelf tiptoed into the room and closed the door securely behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Old man,\" he said, in tones little above a whisper, \"I've got a\n",
      "fortune for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old libeller, leave it with the lift-man,\" said Bones.  \"He has a\n",
      "wife and three children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jelf examined his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to get away at three o'clock, old man,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let me keep you, old writer,\" said Bones with insolent\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jelf smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather not say where I'm going,\" he volunteered.  \"It's a scoop,\n",
      "and if it leaked out, there would be the devil to pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Bones, who knew Mr. Jelf well.  \"I thought it was something\n",
      "like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to tell you, Tibbetts,\" said Jelf regretfully, \"but you know\n",
      "how particular one has to be when one is dealing with matters affecting\n",
      "the integrity of ministers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, I know,\" responded Bones, wilfully dense, \"especially huffy\n",
      "old vicars, dear old thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, them!\" said Jelf, extending his contempt to the rules which govern\n",
      "the employment of the English language.  \"I don't worry about those\n",
      "poor funny things.  No, I am speaking of a matter--you have heard about\n",
      "G.?\" he asked suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Bones with truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jelf looked astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" he said incredulously.  \"You in the heart of things, and don't\n",
      "know about old G.?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, little Mercury, and I don't want to know,\" said Bones, busying\n",
      "himself with his papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll tell me you don't know about L. next,\" he said, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Language!\" protested Bones.  \"You really mustn't use Sunday words,\n",
      "really you mustn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jelf unburdened himself.  It appeared that G. had been engaged to\n",
      "L.'s daughter, and the engagement had been broken off....\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones stirred uneasily and looked at his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dispense with the jolly old alphabet,\" he said wearily, \"and let us\n",
      "get down to the beastly personalities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter Jelf's conversation condensed itself to the limits of a\n",
      "human understanding.  \"G\" stood for Gregory--Felix Gregory; \"L\" for\n",
      "Lansing, who apparently had no Christian name, nor found such appendage\n",
      "necessary, since he was dead.  He had invented a lamp, and that lamp\n",
      "had in some way come into Jelf's possession.  He was exploiting the\n",
      "invention on behalf of the inventor's daughter, and had named it--he\n",
      "said this with great deliberation and emphasis--\"The Tibbetts-Jelf\n",
      "Motor Lamp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones made a disparaging noise, but was interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp was something new in motor lamps.  It was a lamp\n",
      "which had all the advantages of the old lamp, plus properties which no\n",
      "lamp had ever had before, and it had none of the disadvantages of any\n",
      "lamp previously introduced, and, in fact, had no disadvantages\n",
      "whatsoever.  So Jelf told Bones with great earnestness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know me, Tibbetts,\" he said.  \"I never speak about myself, and I'm\n",
      "rather inclined to disparage my own point of view than otherwise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've never noticed that,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know, anyway,\" urged Jelf, \"that I want to see the bad side of\n",
      "anything I take up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He explained how he had sat up night after night, endeavouring to\n",
      "discover some drawback to the Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp, and how he had rolled\n",
      "into bed at five in the morning, exhausted by the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I could only find one flaw!\" he said.  \"But the ingenious beggar\n",
      "who invented it has not left a single bad point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on to describe the lamp.  With the aid of a lead pencil and a\n",
      "piece of Bones's priceless notepaper he sketched the front elevation\n",
      "and discoursed upon rays, especially upon ultra-violet rays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently this is a disreputable branch of the Ray family.  If you\n",
      "could only get an ultra-violet ray as he was sneaking out of the lamp,\n",
      "and hit him violently on the back of the head, you were rendering a\n",
      "service to science and humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lamp was so fixed that the moment Mr. Ultra V. Ray reached the\n",
      "threshold of freedom he was tripped up, pounced upon, and beaten until\n",
      "he (naturally enough) changed colour!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all done by the lens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jelf drew a Dutch cheese on the table-cloth to Illustrate the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This light never goes out,\" said Jelf passionately.  \"If you lit it\n",
      "to-day, it would be alight to-morrow, and the next day, and so on.  All\n",
      "the light-buoys and lighthouses around England will be fitted with this\n",
      "lamp; it will revolutionise navigation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the exploiter, homeward bound mariners would gather\n",
      "together on the poop, or the hoop, or wherever homeward bound manners\n",
      "gathered, and would chant a psalm of praise, in which the line \"Heaven\n",
      "bless the Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp\" would occur at regular intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he had finished his eulogy, and lay back exhausted by his own\n",
      "eloquence, and Bones asked, \"But what does it _do_?\" Jelf could have\n",
      "killed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under any other circumstances Bones might have dismissed his visitor\n",
      "with a lecture on the futility of attempting to procure money under\n",
      "false pretences.  But remember that Bones was the proprietor of a new\n",
      "motor-car, and thought motor-car and dreamed motor-car by day and by\n",
      "night.  Even as it was, he was framing a conventional expression of\n",
      "regret that he could not interest himself in outside property, when\n",
      "there dawned upon his mind the splendid possibilities of possessing\n",
      "this accessory, and he wavered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyway,\" he said, \"it will take a year to make.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jelf beamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wrong!\" he cried triumphantly.  \"Two of the lamps are just finished,\n",
      "and will be ready to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, dear old Jelf,\" he said, \"I should like, as an experiment,\n",
      "to try them on my car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On your car?\"  Jelf stepped back a pace and looked at the other with\n",
      "very flattering interest and admiration.  \"Not your car!  _Have_ you a\n",
      "car?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones said he had a car, and explained it at length.  He even waxed as\n",
      "enthusiastic about his machine as had Mr. Jelf on the subject of the\n",
      "lamp that never went out.  And Jelf agreed with everything that Bones\n",
      "said.  Apparently he was personally acquainted with the Carter-Crispley\n",
      "car.  He had, so to speak, grown up with it.  He knew its good points\n",
      "and none of its bad points.  He thought the man who chose a car like\n",
      "that must have genius beyond the ordinary.  Bones agreed.  Bones had\n",
      "reached the conclusion that he had been mistaken about Jelf, and that\n",
      "possibly age had sobered him (it was nearly six months since he had\n",
      "perpetrated his last libel).  They parted the best of friends.  He had\n",
      "agreed to attend a demonstration at the workshop early the following\n",
      "morning, and Jelf, who was working on a ten per cent. commission basis,\n",
      "and had already drawn a hundred on account from the vendors, was there\n",
      "to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth it was a noble lamp--very much like other motor lamps, except\n",
      "that the bulb was, or apparently was, embedded in solid glass.  Its\n",
      "principal virtue lay in the fact that it carried its own accumulator,\n",
      "which had to be charged weekly, or the lamp forfeited its title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jelf explained, with the adeptness of an expert, how the lamp was\n",
      "controlled from the dashboard, and how splendid it was to have a light\n",
      "which was independent of the engine of the car or of faulty\n",
      "accumulators, and Bones agreed to try the lamp for a week.  He did more\n",
      "than this: he half promised to float a company for its manufacture, and\n",
      "gave Mr. Jelf fifty pounds on account of possible royalties and\n",
      "commission, whereupon Mr. Jelf faded from the picture, and from that\n",
      "moment ceased to take the slightest interest in a valuable article\n",
      "which should have been more valuable by reason of the fact that it bore\n",
      "his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days later Hamilton, walking to business, was overtaken by a\n",
      "beautiful blue Carter-Crispley, ornamented, it seemed from a distance,\n",
      "by two immense bosses of burnished silver.  On closer examination they\n",
      "proved to be nothing more remarkable than examples of the Tibbett-Jelf\n",
      "Lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Bones airily, \"that's the lamp, dear old thing.  Invented\n",
      "in leisure hours by self and Jelf.  Step in, and I'll explain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where do I step in,\" asked Hamilton, wilfully dense--\"into the car or\n",
      "into the lamp?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones patiently smiled and waved him with a gesture to a seat by his\n",
      "side.  His explanation was disjointed and scarcely informative; for\n",
      "Bones had yet to learn the finesse of driving, and he had a trick of\n",
      "thinking aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This lamp, old thing,\" he said, \"never goes out--you silly old josser,\n",
      "why did you step in front of me?  Goodness gracious!  I nearly cut\n",
      "short your naughty old life\"--(this to one unhappy pedestrian whom\n",
      "Bones had unexpectedly met on the wrong side of the road)--\"never goes\n",
      "out, dear old thing.  It's out now, I admit, but it's not in working\n",
      "order--Gosh!  That was a narrow escape!  Nobody but a skilled driver,\n",
      "old Hamilton, could have missed that lamp-post.  It is going to create\n",
      "a sensation; there's nothing like it on the market--whoop!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought the car to a standstill with a jerk and within half an inch\n",
      "of a City policeman who was directing the traffic with his back turned\n",
      "to Bones, blissfully unconscious of the doom which almost overcame him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like driving with you, Bones,\" said Hamilton, when they reached the\n",
      "office, and he had recovered something of his self-possession.  \"Next\n",
      "to stalking bushmen in the wild, wild woods, I know of nothing more\n",
      "soothing to the nerves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bones gratefully.  \"I'm not a bad driver, am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Bad' is not the word I should use alone,\" said Hamilton pointedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the comments which followed, he was surprised and pained to\n",
      "receive on the following day an invitation, couched in such terms as\n",
      "left him a little breathless, to spend the Sunday exploiting the\n",
      "beauties of rural England.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I won't take a 'No,'\" said Bones, wagging his bony forefinger.\n",
      "\"We'll start at eleven o'clock, dear old Ham, and we'll lunch at\n",
      "what-you-may-call-it, dash along the thingummy road, and heigho! for\n",
      "the beautiful sea-breezes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Hamilton curtly.  \"You may dash anywhere you like, but\n",
      "I'm dashed if I dash with you.  I have too high a regard for my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naughty, naughty!\" said Bones, \"I've a good mind not to tell you what\n",
      "I was going to say.  Let me tell you the rest.  Now, suppose,\" he said\n",
      "mysteriously, \"that there's a certain lady--a jolly old girl named\n",
      "Vera--ha--ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton went red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, listen, Bones,\" he said; \"we'll not discuss any other person than\n",
      "ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you say to a day in the country?  Suppose you asked Miss\n",
      "Vera----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Vera Sackwell,\" replied Hamilton a little haughtily, \"if she is\n",
      "the lady you mean, is certainly a friend of mine, but I have no control\n",
      "over her movements.  And let me tell you, Bones, that you annoy me\n",
      "when----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hoity, toity!\" said Bones.  \"Heaven bless my heart and soul!  Can't\n",
      "you trust your old Bones?  Why practise this deception, old thing?  I\n",
      "suppose,\" he went on reflectively, ignoring the approaching apoplexy of\n",
      "his partner, \"I suppose I'm one of the most confided-in persons in\n",
      "London.  A gay old father confessor, Ham, lad.  Everybody tells me\n",
      "their troubles.  Why, the lift-girl told me this morning that she'd had\n",
      "measles twice!  Now, out with it, Ham!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If Hamilton had any tender feeling for Miss Vera Sackwell, he was not\n",
      "disposed to unburden himself at that moment.  In some mysterious\n",
      "fashion Bones, for the first time in his life, had succeeded in\n",
      "reducing him to incoherence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're an ass, Bones!\" he said angrily and hotly.  \"You're not only an\n",
      "ass, but an indelicate ass!  Just oblige me by shutting up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones closed his eyes, smiled, and put out his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever doubts I had, dear old Ham,\" he murmured, \"are dispelled.\n",
      "Congratulations!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That night Hamilton dined with a fair lady.  She was fair literally and\n",
      "figuratively, and as he addressed her as Vera, it was probably her\n",
      "name.  In the course of the dinner he mentioned Bones and his\n",
      "suggestion.  He did not tell all that Bones had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion of a day's motoring was not received unfavourably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he can't drive,\" wailed Hamilton.  \"He's only just learnt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to meet Bones,\" said the girl, \"and I think it a most excellent\n",
      "opportunity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear, suppose the beggar upsets us in a ditch?  I really can't\n",
      "risk your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell Bones that I accept,\" she said decisively, and that ended the\n",
      "matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Hamilton broke the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Sackwell thanks you for your invitation, Bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And accepts, of course?\" said Bones complacently.  \"Jolly old Vera.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I say, old man,\" said Hamilton severely, \"will you be kind enough\n",
      "to remember not to call this lady Vera until she asks you to?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be peevish, old boy, don't be jealous, dear old thing.\n",
      "Brother-officer and all that.  Believe me, you can trust your old\n",
      "Bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather trust the lady's good taste,\" said Hamilton with some\n",
      "acerbity.  \"But won't it be a bit lonely for you, Bones?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what do you mean, my Othello?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean three is a pretty rotten sort of party,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\"Couldn't you dig up somebody to go along and make the fourth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones coughed and was immensely embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, dear old athlete,\" he said unnecessarily loudly, \"I was thinking\n",
      "of asking my--er----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your--er--what?  I gather it's an er,\" said Hamilton seriously, \"but\n",
      "which er?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My old typewriter, frivolous one,\" said Bones truculently.  \"Any\n",
      "objection?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hamilton calmly.  \"Miss Whitland is a most\n",
      "charming girl, and Vera will be delighted to meet her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones choked his gratitude and wrung the other's hand for fully two\n",
      "minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the rest of the week in displaying to Hamilton the frank\n",
      "ambitions of his mind toward Miss Marguerite Whitland.  Whenever he had\n",
      "nothing to do--which seemed most of the day--he strolled across to\n",
      "Hamilton's desk and discoursed upon the proper respect which all\n",
      "right-thinking young officers have for old typewriters.  By the end of\n",
      "the week Hamilton had the confused impression that the very pretty girl\n",
      "who ministered to the literary needs of his partner, combined the\n",
      "qualities of a maiden aunt with the virtues of a grandmother, and that\n",
      "Bones experienced no other emotion than one of reverential wonder,\n",
      "tinctured with complete indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the sixty-fourth lecture Hamilton struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, dear old thing,\" Bones was saying, \"to a jolly old brigand\n",
      "like you, who dashes madly down from his mountain lair and takes the\n",
      "first engaging young person who meets his eye----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton protested vigorously, but Bones silenced him with a lordly\n",
      "gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, to a jolly old rascal like you it may seem--what is the word?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Inexplicable,' I suppose, is the word you are after,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the fellow; you took it out of my mouth,\" said Bones.  \"It\n",
      "sounds inexplicable that I can be interested in a platonic, fatherly\n",
      "kind of way in the future of a lovely old typewriter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not inexplicable at all,\" said Hamilton bluntly.  \"You're in love\n",
      "with the girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious Heavens!\" gasped Bones, horrified.  \"Ham, my dear old\n",
      "boy.  Dicky Orum, Dicky Orum, old thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday morning brought together four solemn people, two of whom were\n",
      "men, who felt extremely awkward and showed it, and two of whom behaved\n",
      "as though they had known one another all their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, who stood alternately on his various legs, was frankly astounded\n",
      "that the meeting had passed off without any sensational happening.  It\n",
      "was an astonishment shared by thousands of men in similar\n",
      "circumstances.  A word of admiration for the car from Vera melted him\n",
      "to a condition of hysterical gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not a bad old 'bus, dear old--Miss Vera,\" he said, and tut-tutted\n",
      "audibly under his breath at his error.  \"Not a bad old 'bus at all,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"They are big, aren't they?\" said Vera, properly impressed by the lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They never go out,\" said Bones solemnly.  \"I assure you I'm looking\n",
      "forward to the return journey with the greatest eagerness--I mean to\n",
      "say, of course, that I'm looking forward to the other journey--I don't\n",
      "mean to say I want the day to finish, and all that sort of rot.  In\n",
      "fact, dear old Miss Vera, I think we'd better be starting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He cranked up and climbed into the driver's seat, and beckoned\n",
      "Marguerite to seat herself by his side.  He might have done this\n",
      "without explanation, but Bones never did things without explanation,\n",
      "and he turned back and glared at Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd like to be alone, dear old thing, wouldn't you?\" he said\n",
      "gruffly.  \"Don't worry about me, dear old lad.  A lot of people say you\n",

      "driving----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get on with it!\" snarled Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, nevertheless, a perfect day, and Bones, to everybody's\n",
      "surprise, his own included, drove perfectly.  It had been his secret\n",
      "intention to drive to Brighton; but nobody suspected this plan, or\n",
      "cared very much what his intentions had been, and the car was running\n",
      "smoothly across Salisbury Plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they stopped for afternoon tea, Hamilton did remark that he\n",
      "thought Bones had said something about Brighton, but Bones just smiled.\n",
      "They left Andover that night in the dusk; but long before the light had\n",
      "faded, the light which was sponsored by Mr. Jelf blazed whitely in the\n",
      "lamp that never went out.  And when the dark came Bones purred with\n",
      "joy, for this light was a wonderful light.  It flooded the road ahead\n",
      "with golden radiance, and illuminated the countryside, so that distant\n",
      "observers speculated upon its origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, old thing,\" said Bones over his shoulder, \"what do you think of\n",
      "the lamps?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Simply wonderful, Bones,\" agreed Hamilton.  \"I've never seen anything\n",
      "so miraculous.  I can even see that you're driving with one hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones brought the other hand up quickly to the wheel and coughed.  As\n",
      "for Miss Marguerite Whitland, she laughed softly, but nobody heard her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were rushing along a country road tree-shaded and high-hedged, and\n",
      "Bones was singing a little song--when the light went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It went out with such extraordinary unexpectedness, without so much as\n",
      "a warning flicker, that he was temporarily blinded, and brought the car\n",
      "to a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's up, Bones?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The light, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"I think the jolly old\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" said Hamilton politely; and Bones, remembering that the key\n",
      "was well over on his side of the car, coughed, this time fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He switched the key from left to right, but nothing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most extraordinary!\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most,\" said Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think the road branches off a little way up I'll get down and see\n",
      "which is the right road to take,\" said Bones with sudden cheerfulness.\n",
      "\"I remember seeing the old signpost before the--er--lamp went out.\n",
      "Perhaps, Miss Marguerite, you'd like to go for a little walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Marguerite Whitland said she thought she would, and they went off\n",
      "together to investigate, leaving Hamilton to speculate upon the\n",
      "likelihood of their getting home that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones walked ahead with Marguerite, and instinctively their hands\n",
      "sought and found one another.  They discovered the cross-roads, but\n",
      "Bones did not trouble to light his match.  His heart was beating with\n",
      "extraordinary violence, his lips were dry, he found much difficulty in\n",
      "speaking at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Marguerite,\" he said huskily, \"don't think I'm an awful outsider\n",
      "and a perfect rotter, dear old typewriter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I don't,\" she said a little faintly for Bones's arm was\n",
      "about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't think,\" said Bones, his voice trembling, \"that I am a naughty\n",
      "old philanderer; but somehow, dear old miss, being alone with you, and\n",
      "all that sort of stuff----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he bent and kissed her, and at that moment the light that never\n",
      "went out came on again with extraordinary fierceness, as though to make\n",
      "up for its temporary absence without leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "And these two young people were focused as in a limelight, and were not\n",
      "only visible from the car, but visible for miles around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl said nothing.  She shaded her eyes from the light as she\n",
      "walked back.  As for Bones, he climbed into the driver's seat with the\n",
      "deliberation of an old gentleman selecting a penny chair in the park,\n",
      "and said, without turning his head:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the road to the left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad,\" said Hamilton, and made no comment even when Bones took the\n",
      "road to the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had gone a quarter of a mile along this highway when the lamp went\n",
      "out.  It went out with as unexpected and startling suddenness as\n",
      "before.  Bones jingled the key, then turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wouldn't like to get out, dear old Ham, and have a look round,\n",
      "would you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Bones,\" said Hamilton drily.  \"We're quite comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wouldn't like to get down, my jolly old typewriter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Miss Marguerite Whitland with decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Bones.  \"Then, under the circumstances, dear old person,\n",
      "we'd all better sit here until----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the light came on.  It flooded the white road, and the\n",
      "white road was an excellent wind-screen against which the bending head\n",
      "of Bones was thrown into sharp relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "The car moved on.  At regular intervals the light that never went out\n",
      "forsook its home-loving habits and took a constitutional.  The\n",
      "occupants of the ear came to regard its eccentricities with philosophy,\n",
      "even though it began to rain, and there was no hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the outskirts of Guildford, Bones was pulled up by a policeman, who\n",
      "took his name because the lights were too bright.  On the other side of\n",
      "Guildford he was pulled up by another policeman because he had no light\n",
      "at all.  Passing through Kingston, the lamp began to flicker, sending\n",
      "forth brilliant dots and dashes, which continued until they were on\n",
      "Putney Common, where the lamp's message was answered from a camp of Boy\n",
      "Scouts, one signalman of the troop being dragged from his bed for the\n",
      "purpose, the innocent child standing in his shirt at the call of duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A delightful day,\" said Hamilton at parting that night.  (It was\n",
      "nearly twelve o'clock.)  \"I'm sorry you've had so much trouble with\n",
      "that lamp, Bones.  What did you call it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, old fellow,\" said Bones, ignoring the question, \"I hope, when\n",
      "you saw me picking a spider off dear old Miss Marguerite's shoulder,\n",
      "you didn't--er--think anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The only thing I thought was,\" said Hamilton, \"that I didn't see the\n",
      "spider.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't stickle, dear old partner,\" said Bones testily.  \"It may have\n",
      "been an earwig.  Now, as a man of the world, dear old _blasé_ one, do\n",
      "you think I'd compromise an innocent typewriter?  Do you think I ought\n",
      "to----\"  He paused, but his voice was eager.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said Hamilton, \"is purely a question for the lady.  Now, what\n",
      "are you going to do with this lamp.  Are you going to float it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones scowled at the glaring headlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That depends whether the naughty old things float, Ham,\" he said\n",
      "venomously.  \"If you think they will, my old eye-witness, how about\n",
      "tyin' a couple of bricks round 'em before I chuck 'em in.  What?\"\n",

      "Not all the investments of Bones paid dividends.  Some cost him money.\n",
      "Some cost him time.  Some--and they were few--cost him both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere in a marine store in London lie the battered wrecks of what\n",
      "were once electro-plated motor-lamps of a peculiar and, to Bones,\n",
      "sinister design.  They were all that was left of a great commercial\n",
      "scheme, based upon the flotation of a lamp that never went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a day of crisis in Bones's life they had gone out, which was bad.\n",
      "They had come on at an inconvenient moment, which was worse, since they\n",
      "had revealed him and his secretary in tender attitudes.  And Bones had\n",
      "gone gaily to right the wrong, and had been received with cold\n",
      "politeness by the lady concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a week of gloom, when Bones adopted towards his invaluable\n",
      "assistant the air and manner of one who was in the last stages of a\n",
      "wasting disease.  Miss Marguerite Whitland never came into Bones's\n",
      "office without finding him sitting at his desk with his head in his\n",
      "hands, except once, when she came in without knocking and Bones hadn't\n",
      "the time to strike that picturesque attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, throughout that week she never saw him but he was swaying, or\n",
      "standing with his hand before his eyes, or clutching on to the edge of\n",
      "a chair, or walking with feeble footsteps; and she never spoke to him\n",
      "but he replied with a tired, wan smile, until she became seriously\n",
      "alarmed, thinking his brain was affected, and consulted Captain\n",
      "Hamilton, his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, Bones, you miserable devil,\" said Hamilton, \"you're scaring\n",
      "that poor girl.  What the dickens do you mean by it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scaring who?\" said Bones, obviously pleased.  \"Am I really?  Is she\n",
      "fearfully cut up, dear old thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is,\" said Hamilton truthfully.  \"She thinks you're going dotty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vulgarity, vulgarity, dear old officer,\" said Bones, much annoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told her you were often like that,\" Hamilton went on wilfully.  \"I\n",
      "said that you were a little worse, if anything, after your last love\n",
      "affair----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heavens!\" nearly screamed Bones.  \"You didn't tell her anything about\n",
      "your lovely old sister Patricia?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not,\" said Hamilton.  \"I merely pointed out to her the fact that\n",
      "when you were in love you were not to be distinguished from one whom is\n",
      "the grip of measles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you're a naughty old fellow,\" said Bones.  \"You're a wicked old\n",
      "rascal.  I'm surprised at you!  Can't a fellow have a little heart\n",
      "trouble----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heart?  Bah!\" said Hamilton scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heart trouble,\" repeated Bones sternly.  \"I've always had a weak\n",
      "heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a weak head, too,\" said Hamilton.  \"Now, just behave yourself,\n",
      "Bones, and stop frightening the lady.  I'm perfectly sure she's fond of\n",
      "you--in a motherly kind of way,\" he added, as he saw Bones's face light\n",
      "up.  \"And, really, she is such an excellent typist that it would be a\n",
      "sin and a shame to frighten her from the office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This possibility had not occurred to Bones, and it is likely it had\n",
      "more effect than any other argument which Hamilton could use.  That day\n",
      "he began to take an interest in life, stepped gaily into the office and\n",
      "as blithely into his secretary's room.  He even made jokes, and dared\n",
      "invite her to tea--an invitation which was declined so curtly that\n",
      "Bones decided that tea was an unnecessary meal, and cut it out\n",
      "forthwith.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the business of Schemes Limited was going forward, if not\n",
      "by leaps and bounds, yet by steady progression.  Perhaps it was the\n",
      "restraining influence that Hamilton exercised which prevented the leaps\n",
      "being too pronounced and kept the bounds within bounds, so to speak.\n",
      "It was Schemes Limited which bought the theatrical property of the late\n",
      "Mr. Liggeinstein and re-sold those theatres in forty-eight hours at a\n",
      "handsome profit.  It was Bones who did the buying, and it was Hamilton\n",
      "who did the selling--in this case, to the intense annoyance of Bones,\n",
      "who had sat up the greater part of one night writing a four-act play in\n",
      "blank verse, and arriving at the office late, had discovered that his\n",
      "chance of acting as his own producer had passed for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I'd written a most wonderful part for you, dear old mademoiselle,\"\n",
      "he said sadly to his secretary.  \"The part where you die in the third\n",
      "act--well, really, it brought tears to my jolly old eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think Captain Hamilton was very wise to accept the offer of the\n",
      "Colydrome Syndicate,\" said the girl coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his leisure moments Bones had other relaxations than the writing of\n",
      "poetry--now never mentioned--or four-act tragedies.  What Hamilton had\n",
      "said of him was true.  He had an extraordinary nose for a bargain, and\n",
      "found his profits in unexpected places.\n",
      "\n",
      "People got to know him--quite important people, men who handled\n",
      "millions carelessly, like Julius Bohea, and Important Persons whose\n",
      "faces are familiar to the people of Britain, such as the Right Hon.\n",
      "George Parkinson Chenney.  Bones met that most influential member of\n",
      "the Cabinet at a very superior dinner-party, where everybody ate\n",
      "plovers' eggs as though it were a usual everyday occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Parkinson Chenney talked on his favourite subject with great\n",
      "ease and charm, and his favourite subject was the question of the\n",
      "Chinese Concession.  Apparently everybody had got concessions in China\n",
      "except the British, until one of our cleverest diplomatists stepped in\n",
      "and procured for us the most amazingly rich coalfield of Wei-hai-tai.\n",
      "The genius and foresight of this diplomatist--who had actually gone to\n",
      "China in the Long Vacation, and of his own initiative and out of his\n",
      "own head had evolved these concessions, which were soon to be ratified\n",
      "by a special commission which was coming from China--was a theme on\n",
      "which Mr. Parkinson Chenney spoke with the greatest eloquence.  And\n",
      "everybody listened respectfully, because he was a great man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not for me,\" said Mr. Parkinson Chenney, toying with the stem of\n",
      "his champagne glass and closing his eyes modestly, \"I say it is not for\n",
      "me--thank you, Perkins, I will have just as much as will come up to the\n",
      "brim; thank you, that will do very nicely--to speak boastfully or to\n",
      "enlarge unduly upon what I regard as a patriotic effort, and one which\n",
      "every citizen of these islands would in the circumstances have made,\n",
      "but I certainly plume myself upon the acumen and knowledge of the\n",
      "situation which I showed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear, hear!\" said Bones in the pause that followed, and Mr. Parkinson\n",
      "Chenney beamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the dinner was over, and the guests retired to the smoking-room,\n",
      "Bones buttonholed the minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old right honourable,\" said Bones, \"may I just have a few words\n",
      "in _re_ Chinese coal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The right honourable gentleman listened, or appeared to listen.  Then\n",
      "Mr. Parkinson Chenney smiled a recognition to another great man, and\n",
      "moved off, leaving Bones talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones that night was the guest of a Mr. Harold Pyeburt, a City\n",
      "acquaintance--almost, it seemed, a disinterested City acquaintance.\n",
      "When Bones joined his host, Mr. Pyeburt patted him on the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Tibbetts,\" he said in admiration, \"you've made a hit with\n",
      "Chenney.  What the dickens did you talk about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, coal,\" said Bones vaguely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wasn't quite certain what he had talked about, only he knew that in\n",
      "his mind at dinner there had dawned a great idea.  Was Mr. Pyeburt a\n",
      "thought-reader?  Possibly he was.  Or possibly some chance word of his\n",
      "had planted the seed which was now germinating so favourably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chenney is a man to know,\" he said.  \"He's one of the most powerful\n",
      "fellows in the Cabinet.  Get right with him, and you can have a\n",
      "knighthood for the asking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A knighthood, dear old broker's man?\" he said, with an elaborate\n",
      "shrug.  \"No use to me, my rare old athlete.  Lord Bones--Lord Tibbetts\n",
      "I mean--may sound beastly good, but what good is it, eh?  Answer me\n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Mr. Pyeburt.  \"It may be nothing to you, but\n",
      "your wife----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haven't a wife, haven't a wife,\" said Bones rapidly, \"haven't a wife!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, then,\" said Mr. Pyeburt, \"it isn't an attractive proposition\n",
      "to you, and, after all, you needn't take a knighthood--which, by the\n",
      "way, doesn't carry the title of lordship--unless you want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've often thought,\" he said, screwing up his forehead, as though in\n",
      "the process of profound cogitation, \"that one of these days some lucky\n",
      "fellow will take the Lynhaven Railway off Chenney's hands and earn his\n",
      "everlasting gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lynhaven?  Where's that?\" asked Bones.  \"Is there a railway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pyeburt nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come out on to the balcony, and I'll tell you about it,\" said Pyeburt;\n",
      "and Bones, who always wanted telling about things, and could no more\n",
      "resist information than a dipsomaniac could refuse drink, followed\n",
      "obediently.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that Mr. Parkinson Chenney's father was a rich but\n",
      "eccentric man, who had a grudge against a certain popular seaside\n",
      "resort for some obscure reason, and had initiated a movement to found a\n",
      "rival town.  So he had started Lynhaven, and had built houses and\n",
      "villas and beautiful assembly rooms; and then, to complete the\n",
      "independence of Lynhaven, he had connected that town with the main\n",
      "traffic line by railway, which he built across eight miles of\n",
      "marshland.  By all the rules of the game, no man can create\n",
      "successfully in a spirit of vengeance, and Lynhaven should have been a\n",
      "failure.  It was, indeed, a great success, and repaid Mr. Chenney,\n",
      "Senior, handsomely.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the railway, it seemed, was a failure, because the rival town had\n",
      "certain foreshore rights, and had employed those to lay a tramway from\n",
      "their hustling centre; and as the rival town was on the main line, the\n",
      "majority of visitors preferred going by the foreshore route in\n",
      "preference to the roundabout branch line route, which was somewhat\n",
      "handicapped by the fact that this, too, connected with the branch line\n",
      "at Tolness, a little town which had done great work in the War, but\n",
      "which did not attract the tourist in days of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the facts about the Lynhaven line, not as they were set\n",
      "forth by Mr. Pyeburt--who took a much more optimistic view of the\n",
      "possibilities of the railway than did its detractors--but as they\n",
      "really were.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a fine line, beautifully laid and ballasted,\" said Mr. Pyeburt,\n",
      "shaking his head with melancholy admiration.  \"All that it wants behind\n",
      "it is a mind.  At present it's neglected; the freights and passenger\n",
      "fares are too high, the rolling-stock wants replacing, but the\n",
      "locomotive stock is in most excellent condition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does he want to sell it?\" asked the interested Bones, and Mr. Pyeburt\n",
      "pursed his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is extremely doubtful,\" he said carefully, \"but I think he might be\n",
      "approached.  If he does want to sell it, and you can take it off his\n",
      "hands----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his own eyebrows with a significant gesture, which expressed\n",
      "in some subtle way that Bones's future was assured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones said he would think the matter over, and he did--aloud, in the\n",
      "presence of Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a queer proposition,\" said Hamilton.  \"Of course, derelict\n",
      "railways can be made to pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be general manager,\" said Bones more thoughtfully still.  \"My\n",
      "name would be printed on all the posters, of course.  And isn't there a\n",
      "free pass over all the railways for railway managers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe there is something of the sort,\" said Hamilton, \"but, on the\n",
      "whole, I think it would be cheaper to pay your fare than to buy a\n",
      "railway to get that privilege.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is one locomotive,\" mused Bones.  \"It is called 'Mary Louisa.'\n",
      "Pyeburt told me about it just as I was going away.  Of course, one\n",
      "would get a bit of a name and all that sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He scratched his chin and walked thoughtfully into the office of Miss\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swung round in her chair and reached for her notebook, but Bones\n",
      "was not in a dictatorial mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young miss,\" he asked, \"how do you like Sir Augustus?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir who?\" she demanded, puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir Augustus,\" repeated Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's very funny,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not the answer he expected, and instinctively she knew she had\n",
      "made a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you're thinking about yourself,\" she said quickly.  \"Are you going\n",
      "to be a knight, Mr. Tibbetts?  Oh, how splendid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" admitted Bones, with fine indifference, \"not bad, dear old miss.\n",
      "I'm pretty young, of course, but Napoleon was a general at twenty-two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going back into the Army?\" she asked a little hazily, and had\n",
      "visions of Bones at the War Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm talking about railways,\" said Bones firmly.  \"Sir Augustus\n",
      "Tibbetts--there, now I've said it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wonderful!\" said the girl enthusiastically, and her eyes shone with\n",
      "genuine pleasure.  \"I didn't see it in the newspaper, or I would have\n",
      "congratulated you before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shifted uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact, dear old miss,\" he said, \"it has not been\n",
      "gazetted yet.  I'm merely speaking of the future, dear old impetuous\n",
      "typewriter and future secretary to the Lynhaven Railway Company, and\n",
      "possibly dear old Lady----\"  He stopped short with one of his audible\n",
      "\"tuts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily she could not see the capital \"L\" to the word \"Lady,\" and\n",
      "missed the significance of Bones's interrupted speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw Mr. Harold Pyeburt at his office, and Mr. Harold Pyeburt had\n",
      "seen the Right Hon. Parkinson Chenney, and the right honourable\n",
      "gentleman had expressed his willingness to sell the railway, lock,\n",
      "stock, and barrel, for sixty thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I advise you\"--Mr. Pyeburt paused, as he thought of a better word\n",
      "than \"disinterestedly\"--\"as a friend, to jump at it.  Parkinson Chenney\n",
      "spoke in the highest terms of you.  You evidently made a deep\n",
      "impression upon him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is the jolly old Parkinson's agent?\" asked Bones, and Mr. Harold\n",
      "Pyeburt admitted without embarrassment that, as a matter of fact, he\n",
      "was acting as Parkinson's attorney in this matter, and that was why he\n",
      "had been so diffident in recommending the property.  The audacity of\n",
      "the latter statement passed unnoticed by Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end Bones agreed to pay ten per cent. of the purchase price, the\n",
      "remainder to be paid after a month's working of the line, if the deal\n",
      "was approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clever idea of mine, dear old Ham,\" said Bones.  \"The Honours List\n",
      "will be out in a month, and I can easily chuck it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's about the eighth fellow who's paid a ten per cent. deposit,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Chenney to his agent.  \"I'll be almost sorry if he takes it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three weeks later there were two important happenings.  The Prime\n",
      "Minister of England, within an hour of leaving for the West of England\n",
      "to take a well-earned rest, summoned to him his right-hand man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chenney,\" he said, \"I really must go away for this rest, and I'm\n",
      "awfully sorry I cannot be on hand to meet the Chinese Commission.  Now,\n",
      "whatever you do, you will not fail to meet them at Charing Cross on\n",
      "their arrival from the Continent.  I believe they are leaving Paris\n",
      "to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be there,\" said Parkinson Chenney, with a little smile.  \"I\n",
      "rather fancy I have managed their coal concession well, Prime Minister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said the Prime Minister, who was not in the mood for\n",
      "handing out bouquets.  \"And would you run down to Tolness and settle up\n",
      "that infernal commission of inquiry?  They've been asking questions in\n",
      "the House, and I can give no very definite reply.  Solebury threatened\n",
      "to force a division when the vote came up.  Undoubtedly there's been a\n",
      "great deal of extravagance, but you may be able to wangle a reasonable\n",
      "explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trust me, Prime Minister,\" said Mr. Parkinson Chenney, and left that\n",
      "afternoon by special train for Tolness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that very morning Bones, in a pair of overalls and with a rapt\n",
      "expression, stood with his hand on the starting lever of \"Mary Louisa,\"\n",
      "and explained to the secretary of the company--she also wore white\n",
      "overalls and sat in the cab of the engine--just how simple a matter it\n",
      "was to drive a locomotive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two glorious days Bones had driven the regular service between\n",
      "Lynhaven and Bayham Junction, where the lines met.  He had come to know\n",
      "every twist and turn of the road, every feature of the somewhat\n",
      "featureless landscape, and the four passengers who travelled regularly\n",
      "every day except Sundays--there was no Sunday service--were now so\n",
      "familiar to him that he did not trouble to take their tickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lynhaven Railway system was not as elaborate as he had thought.  He\n",
      "had been impressed by the number of railway trucks which stood in the\n",
      "siding at the terminus, but was to discover that they did not belong to\n",
      "the railway, the rolling stock of which consisted of \"Mary Louisa,\" an\n",
      "asthmatic but once famous locomotive, and four weather-beaten coaches.\n",
      "The remainder of the property consisted of a half right in a bay\n",
      "platform at Bayham Junction and the dilapidated station building at\n",
      "Lynhaven, which was thoughtfully situated about two miles from the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody used the railway; that was the stark truth borne in upon\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland.  She recognised, with a sense of dismay, the\n",
      "extraordinary badness of the bargain which Bones had made.  Bones, with\n",
      "a real locomotive to play with--he had given the aged engine-driver a\n",
      "week's holiday--saw nothing but the wonderful possibilities of pulling\n",
      "levers and making a mass of rusting machinery jerk asthmatically\n",
      "forward at the touch of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are a lot of people,\" said Bones, affectionately patting a steam\n",
      "pipe, \"a lot of people,\" he said, after sucking his fingers, for the\n",
      "steam was extraordinarily hot, \"who think poor old 'Mary Louisa' is\n",
      "done for.  Believe me, dear old miss, this locomotive wants a jolly lot\n",
      "of beating, she does really.  I haven't tried her full out--have I,\n",
      "jolly old stoker?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The jolly old stoker, aged seventeen, shook a grimy face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And don't you try, neither,\" he said ominously.  \"Old George, he never\n",
      "takes her more than quarter speed, he don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you hear, dear old miss?\" said Bones triumphantly.  \"Not more than\n",
      "quarter speed.  I tell you I could make enough money out of this engine\n",
      "alone to pay the whole cost of the railway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about giving engine-driving lessons?  That's an idea!  And what\n",
      "about doing wonderful cinema pictures?  That's another idea!  Thrilling\n",
      "rescues from the train; jolly old hero struggling like mad on the roof\n",
      "of the carriage; railway collisions, and so forth, and so on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't have a collision unless you've two engines,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" said the optimistic Bones, \"we could perhaps borrow an\n",
      "engine from the Great Northern.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at the girl, then looked at his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time to be up and doing, dear old thing,\" he said, and looked back\n",
      "along the little train.  The aged guard was sitting on a barrow, his\n",
      "nodding head testifying to the sleep-giving qualities of Lynhaven air.\n",
      "Bones jerked the whistle, there was an unearthly shriek, and the guard\n",
      "woke up.  He looked at his watch, yawned, searched the train for\n",
      "passengers, waved his flag, and climbed into his little compartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine shrieked again.  Bones pulled over the lever gently, and\n",
      "there was a gratifying chuck-chuck-chuck.  Bones smiled down at the\n",
      "girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Easy as shelling peas, dear old thing,\" he said, \"and this time I'm\n",
      "going to show you just how she can go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Old Joe don't let her go more than quarter speed,\" said the diminutive\n",
      "stoker warningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blow old Joe!\" said Bones severely.  \"He's a jolly unenterprising old\n",
      "engine-driver.  That's why the naughty old line doesn't pay.  The idea\n",
      "of running 'Mary Louisa' at quarter speed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to the girl for approval, but she felt that, in the\n",
      "circumstances and with only the haziest knowledge of engineering, it\n",
      "would be wiser to offer no opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones pushed the lever a little farther over, and the \"Mary Louisa\"\n",
      "reeled under the shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In _re_ knighthood, dear old miss,\" said Bones confidentially.  His\n",
      "words came jerkily, because the footplate of an outraged locomotive\n",
      "pounding forward at an unaccustomed speed was not a good foundation for\n",
      "continued eloquence.  \"Rendering the jolly old country a\n",
      "service--helping the Cabinet--dear old Chenney awfully fond of me----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't we going rather fast?\" said the girl, gripping the side of the\n",
      "cab for support.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" jerked Bones, \"not at all.  I am going to show 'em just\n",
      "how this----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a touch on his arm, and looked down at the diminutive stoker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a lot of sand round here,\" said the melancholy child; \"it\n",
      "won't hurt you to jump I'm going to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jump!\" gasped Bones.  \"What do you mean?  Hey!  Don't do that, you\n",
      "silly young----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But his black-visaged assistant was already poised on the step of the\n",
      "engine, and Bones, looking back, saw him performing somersaults down a\n",
      "sandy slope.  Bones looked at the girl in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suicide, dear old miss!\" he said in an awed voice.  \"Terrible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that a station?\" said the girl, more interested for the moment\n",
      "in her own future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones peered through the windows ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the junction, dear old thing,\" he said.  \"This is where we stop\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He tugged at the lever, but the lever was not to be moved.  He tugged\n",
      "desperately, but it seemed the steel bar was riveted in position.  The\n",
      "\"Mary Louisa\" was leaping along at an incredible speed, and less than\n",
      "five hundred yards away was the dead-end of the Bayham platform, into\n",
      "which the Lynhaven train was due to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones went white and looked at the girl with fearful eyes.  He took a\n",
      "swift scrutiny to the left and right, but they had passed out of the\n",
      "sandy country, and any attempt to leave the train now would mean\n",
      "certain destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "The Right Honourable Mr. Parkinson Chenney had concluded a very\n",
      "satisfactory morning's work of inspection at Tolness, and had secured\n",
      "all the information he needed to answer any question which might be put\n",
      "to him in Parliament by the best-informed of questioners.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was lunching with the officers of the small garrison, when a\n",
      "telephone message was brought to him.  He read it and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" he said.  \"Gentlemen, I am afraid I have to leave you a little\n",
      "earlier than I expected.  Colonel Wraggle, will you see that my special\n",
      "train is ready!  I must leave in ten minutes.  The Chinese Commission\n",
      "has arrived,\" he said impressively, \"or, rather, it arrives in London\n",
      "this afternoon, and I am deputed by the Prime Minister----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He explained to his respectful audience just what part he had played in\n",
      "securing Chinese Coal Concessions.  He made a little speech on the\n",
      "immense value to the Empire in particular and the world in general of\n",
      "these new coalfields which had been secured to the country through the\n",
      "acumen, genius, forethought, and patriotic disinterestedness of the\n",
      "Cabinet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not claim to set any particular merit on his own action, and\n",
      "went on to claim it.  By which time his train was ready.  It was indeed\n",
      "vital that he should be in London to meet a commission which had shown\n",
      "such reluctance to trade with foreign devils, and had been, moreover,\n",
      "so punctilious in its demand for ceremonious receptions, but he had not\n",
      "the slightest doubt about his ability to reach London before the boat\n",
      "train arrived.  He had two and a half hours, and two and a half hours\n",
      "gave him an ample margin of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before his special rounded the bend which brought it within sight\n",
      "of Bayham Junction the Lynhaven express had reached within a few\n",
      "hundred yards of annihilation.  The signalman at Bayham Junction had\n",
      "watched the oncoming rush of Bones's train, and, having a fairly\n",
      "extensive knowledge of the \"Mary Louisa\" and her eccentricities, he\n",
      "realised just what had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only one thing to be done.  He could see the smoke from the\n",
      "Cabinet Minister's special rising above the cutting two miles away, and\n",
      "he threw over two levers simultaneously.  The first set the points\n",
      "which brought the Lynhaven express on to the main line, switching it\n",
      "from the deadly bay wherein the runaway train would have been smashed\n",
      "to pieces; the second lever set the distant signal against the special.\n",
      "It was a toss-up whether the special had not already passed the distant\n",
      "signal, but he had to take that risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones, with his arm round the girl, awaiting a noisy and violent\n",
      "dissolution, felt the \"Mary Louisa\" sway to the right when it should\n",
      "have swayed to the left, heard the clang of the points as he passed\n",
      "them, and drew a long breath when he found himself headed along a\n",
      "straight clear stretch of line.  It was some time before he found his\n",
      "voice, and then it was little more than a squeak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're going to London, dear old thing,\" he said tremulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl smiled, though her face was deathly pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought we were going to heaven,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, dear old thing,\" said Bones, recovering something of his\n",
      "spirits as he saw the danger past.  \"Old Bones will never send you\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of the \"Mary Louisa\" was still unsettled.  She was tearing\n",
      "away like a Flying Dutchman.  She was oozing steam at every pore, and,\n",
      "glancing back, Bones saw the agitated countenance of the aged guard\n",
      "thrust through the window.  He waved frantically at Bones, and Bones\n",
      "waved genially back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was turning back to make another attempt on the lever, when, looking\n",
      "past the guard, he saw a sight which brought his heart into his mouth.\n",
      "Pounding along behind him, and emitting feathers of steam from her\n",
      "whistle, was an enormous locomotive.  Bones guessed there was a train\n",
      "behind it, but the line was too straight for him to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious heavens!\" he gasped.  \"We're being chased!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He jerked at the lever--though it was a moment when he should have left\n",
      "it severely alone--and to his ill-founded joy it moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two trains came to a standstill together ten miles from Bayham\n",
      "Junction, and Bones climbed down into the six-foot way and walked back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost the first person he met was a gesticulating gentleman in a frock\n",
      "coat and with a red face, who, mistaking him for an engine-driver,\n",
      "dismissed him on the spot, threatened him with imprisonment--with or\n",
      "without hard labour he did not specify--and demanded what the dickens\n",
      "he meant by holding up a Cabinet Minister?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" chortled Bones, \"isn't it my dear friend, Mr. Chenney?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you,\" snarled Mr. Chenney, \"and what do you mean by calling me\n",
      "your dear friend?  By Heavens, I'll have you kicked out of this\n",
      "service!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you know old Tibbetts?\" cooed Bones.  \"Well, well, fancy meeting\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He held out a grimy hand, which was not taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tibbetts!\" growled the gentleman.  \"Oh, you are the foo--the gentleman\n",
      "who bought the Lynhaven line, didn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what is your train doing here?\" asked Mr. Chenney violently.\n",
      "\"Don't you realise you are holding up a special?  Great Heavens, man,\n",
      "this is very serious!  You are holding up the business of the country!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine-driver of the special came to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a switch-over about half a mile further on,\" he said.\n",
      "\"There's not a down train due for an hour.  I'll unlock the switch and\n",
      "put you on to the other line, and, after we have passed, you can come\n",
      "on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't want to come on, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"I want to\n",
      "go back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's simple,\" said the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "He it was who piloted the Lynhaven express for another half-mile up the\n",
      "road.  He it was who found the switches, unlocked them, telegraphed to\n",
      "the next station to hold up traffic, and he it was--Bones insisted upon\n",
      "this--who brought the \"Mary Louisa\" along the switch to the down line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The position was as follows: The \"Mary Louisa\" was on the down line.\n",
      "Two coaches were between the down and the up line, and the guard's van\n",
      "was exactly on the up line, when the \"Mary Louisa\" refused to work any\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the experienced engine-driver, nor Bones, nor the stoker of the\n",
      "special, nor Mr. Chenney, nor the ancient guard, could coax the \"Mary\n",
      "Louisa\" to move another yard.  The Lynhaven express stretched across\n",
      "both lines and made all further progress for traffic impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three hours later a breakdown gang arrived and towed the \"Mary Louisa\"\n",
      "and her appendages back to Bayham Junction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones and the girl went back to London by the last train, and Bones was\n",
      "very thoughtful and silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bones was ever an optimist.  The next morning he saw on a newspaper\n",
      "placard: \"Birthday Honours.  Twenty-two New Knights.\"  And he actually\n",
      "stopped his car, bought a paper, and searched the lists for his name.\n",

      "A STUDENT OF MEN\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jackson Hyane was one of those oldish-looking young men to whom the\n",
      "description of \"man about town\" most naturally applied.  He was always\n",
      "well-dressed and correctly dressed.  You saw him at first nights.  He\n",
      "was to be seen in the paddock at Ascot--it was a shock to discover that\n",
      "he had not the Royal Enclosure badge on the lapel of his coat--and he\n",
      "was to be met with at most of the social functions, attendance at which\n",
      "did not necessarily imply an intimate acquaintance with the leaders of\n",
      "Society, yet left the impression that the attendant was, at any rate,\n",
      "in the swim, and might very well be one of the principal swimmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lived off Albemarle Street in a tiny flat, and did no work of any\n",
      "kind whatever.  His friends, especially his new friends, thought he\n",
      "\"had a little money,\" and knew, since he told them, that he had\n",
      "expectations.  He did not tell them that his expectations were largely\n",
      "bound up in their credulity and faith in his integrity.  Some of them\n",
      "discovered that later, but the majority drifted out of his circle\n",
      "poorer without being wiser, for Mr. Hyane played a wonderful game of\n",
      "piquet, and seemed to be no more than abnormally lucky.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother had been a Miss Whitland, his father was the notorious\n",
      "Colonel Hyane, who boasted that his library was papered with High Court\n",
      "writs, and who had had the distinction of being escorted from Monte\n",
      "Carlo by the police of the Principality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jackson Hyane was a student of men and affairs.  Very little\n",
      "escaped his keen observation, and he had a trick of pigeon-holing\n",
      "possibilities of profit, and forgetting them until the moment seemed\n",
      "ripe for their exploitation.  He was tall and handsome, with a smile\n",
      "which was worth at least five thousand pounds a year to him, for it\n",
      "advertised his boyish innocence and enthusiasm--he who had never been\n",
      "either a boy or enthusiastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "One grey October day he put away his pass-book into a drawer and locked\n",
      "it, and took from a mental pigeon-hole the materials of an immature\n",
      "scheme.  He dressed himself soberly and well, strolled down into\n",
      "Piccadilly, and calling a cab, drove to the block of City buildings\n",
      "which housed the flourishing business of Tibbetts and Hamilton, Limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preliminaries to this invasion had been very carefully settled.  He\n",
      "had met Miss Marguerite Whitland by \"accident\" a week before, had\n",
      "called at her lodgings with an old photograph of her father, which he\n",
      "had providentially discovered, and had secured from her a somewhat\n",
      "reluctant acceptance of an invitation to lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones looked up from his desk as the debonair young man strolled in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know me, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Jackson Hyane, flashing his\n",
      "famous smile.  \"My name is Hyane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his first meeting with Bones, but by no means the first time\n",
      "that Jackson had seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear old Hyane, sit down,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"What can we do\n",
      "for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hyane laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's nothing you can do for me, except to spare your secretary for\n",
      "an hour longer than she usually takes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My secretary?\" said Bones quickly, and shot a suspicious glance at the\n",
      "visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean Miss Whitland,\" said Hyane easily.  \"She is my cousin, you\n",
      "know.  My mother's brother was her father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones a little stiffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a sense of the strongest resentment against the late Professor\n",
      "Whitland.  He felt that Marguerite's father had played rather a low\n",
      "trick on him in having a sister at all, and Mr. Hyane was too keen a\n",
      "student to overlook Bones's obvious annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he went on carelessly, \"we are quite old friends, Marguerite and\n",
      "I, and you can't imagine how pleased I am that she has such an\n",
      "excellent job as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones, clearing his throat.  \"Very nice old--very good\n",
      "typewriter indeed, Mr. Hyane ... very nice person ... ahem!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marguerite, dressed for the street, came in from her office at that\n",
      "moment, and greeted her cousin with a little nod, which, to the\n",
      "distorted vision of Bones, conveyed the impression of a lifelong\n",
      "friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have just been asking Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane, \"if he could spare\n",
      "you for an extra hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid that can't----\" the girl began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" said Bones, raising his voice as he invariably\n",
      "did when he was agitated.  \"Certainly, my dear old--er--my dear\n",
      "young--er--certainly, Miss Marguerite, by all means, take your cousin\n",
      "to the Zoo ...  I mean show him the sights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was patently agitated, and watched the door close on the two young\n",
      "people with so ferocious a countenance that Hamilton, a silent observer\n",
      "of the scene, could have laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones walked slowly back to his desk as Hamilton reached for his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, Bones,\" he said briskly.  \"It's lunch time.  I had no idea it\n",
      "was so late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bones shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you, dear old thing,\" he said sadly.  \"I'd rather not, if\n",
      "you don't mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you coming to lunch?\" asked Hamilton, astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear old boy,\" he said hollowly.  \"Ask the girl to send me up a\n",
      "stiff glass of soda-water and a biscuit--I don't suppose I shall eat\n",
      "the biscuit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" said Hamilton.  \"Half an hour ago you were telling me you\n",
      "could eat a cart-horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not now, old Ham,\" said Bones.  \"If you've ordered it, send it back.\n",
      "I hate cart-horses, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along,\" wheedled Hamilton, dropping his hand on the other's\n",
      "shoulder.  \"Come and eat.  Who was the beautiful boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beautiful boy?\" laughed Bones bitterly.  \"A fop, dear old Ham!  A\n",
      "tailor's dummy!  A jolly old clothes-horse--that's what he was.  I\n",
      "simply loathe these people who leap around the City for a funeral.\n",
      "It's not right, dear old thing.  It's not manly, dear old sport.  What\n",
      "the devil did her father have a sister for?  I never knew anything\n",
      "about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They ought to have told you,\" said Hamilton sympathetically.  \"Now\n",
      "come and have some food.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bones refused.  He was adamant.  He would sit there and starve.  He\n",
      "did not say as much, but he hinted that, when Hamilton returned, his\n",
      "famished and lifeless form would be found lying limply across the desk.\n",
      "Hamilton went out to lunch alone, hurried through his meal, and came\n",
      "back to find Bones alive but unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat making faces at the table, muttering incoherent words,\n",
      "gesticulating at times in the most terrifying manner, and finally threw\n",
      "himself back into his deep chair, his hands thrust into his trousers\n",
      "pockets, the picture of dejection and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was three o'clock when Miss Marguerite Whitland returned breathless,\n",
      "and, to Bones's jealous eye, unnecessarily agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, dear old miss,\" he said testily.  \"Bring your book.  I\n",
      "wish to dictate an important letter.  Enjoyed your lunch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The last question was asked in so threatening a tone that the girl\n",
      "almost jumped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--no,\" she said.  \"Not very much really.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" said Bones, insultingly sceptical, and she went red, flounced\n",
      "into her room, and returned, after five minutes, a haughty and distant\n",
      "young woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I want to dictate, dear old--dear young typewriter,\" he\n",
      "said unhappily.  \"Leave me, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, my dear Bones,\" protested Hamilton, when the girl had gone\n",
      "back, scarlet-faced to her office, \"you're making a perfect ass of\n",
      "yourself.  If a girl cannot go to lunch with her cousin----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones jumped up from his chair, shrugged his shoulders rapidly, and\n",
      "forced a hideous grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does it matter to me, dear old Ham?\" he asked.  \"Don't think I'm\n",
      "worried about a little thing like a typewriter going out to lunch.\n",
      "Pooh!  Absurd!  Tommy rot!  No, my partner, I don't mind--in fact, I\n",
      "don't care a----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jot,\" said Hamilton, with the gesture of an outraged bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Bones wildly.  \"What does it matter to me?\n",
      "Delighted that young typewriter should have a cousin, and all that sort\n",
      "of thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what the dickens is the matter with you?\" asked Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Bones, and laughed more wildly than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationships between Mr. Augustus Tibbetts, Managing Director of\n",
      "Schemes Limited, and Miss Marguerite Whitland, his heaven-sent\n",
      "secretary, were strained to the point of breaking that afternoon.  She\n",
      "went away that night without saying good-bye, and Bones, in a condition\n",
      "of abject despair, walked home to Devonshire Street, and was within a\n",
      "dozen yards of his flat, when he remembered that he had left his\n",
      "motor-car in the City, and had to take a cab back to fetch it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones,\" said Hamilton the next morning, \"do you realise the horrible\n",
      "gloom which has come over this office?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gloom, dear old Ham?\" said the dark-eyed Bones.  He had spent the\n",
      "night writing letters to Marguerite, and had exhausted all the\n",
      "stationery in sight in the process.  \"Gloom, old thing!  Good gracious,\n",
      "no!  Nobody is gloomy here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can tell you somebody who is,\" said Hamilton grimly.  \"That\n",
      "unfortunate girl you've been barking at all the morning----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Barking at her?\" gasped Bones.  \"Gracious Heavens, I haven't betrayed\n",
      "my worried condition of mind, dear old thing?  I thought I hid it\n",
      "rather well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What on earth are you worried about?\" asked Hamilton, and Bones\n",
      "shrugged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing,\" he said.  \"Nothing at all.  A little fever, dear old\n",
      "thing, contracted in the service of King--God bless him!--and country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton's words had this effect, that he brightened visibly, and for\n",
      "the rest of the morning was almost normal.  His spirits took a quick\n",
      "downward turn at five minutes to one, when the debonair Mr. Hyane\n",
      "appeared most unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you'll think I'm a most awful nuisance, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he\n",
      "said, \"but there are so many things which I must really talk to my\n",
      "cousin about--family affairs, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't apologise,\" said Bones gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shan't keep her beyond the hour,\" smiled Mr. Hyane.  \"I realise that\n",
      "you are a very busy man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones said nothing, and when Marguerite Whitland appeared, he had\n",
      "gained sufficient control of his emotions to indulge in a feeble jest.\n",
      "The girl's face was a study at the sight of her cousin.  Hamilton, a\n",
      "disinterested observer, read astonishment, annoyance, and resignation\n",
      "in the wide-opened eyes.  Bones, who prided himself upon a working\n",
      "knowledge of physiognomy, diagnosed the same symptoms as conveying a\n",
      "deep admiration combined with the re-awakening of a youthful love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jackson!\" she said coldly.  \"I didn't expect to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you I would call,\" he smiled.  \"I must see you, Marguerite, and\n",
      "Mr. Tibbetts has been so kind that I am sure he will not mind me----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Tibbetts is not concerned about the manner in which I spend my\n",
      "lunch hour,\" she said stiffly, and Bones groaned inwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silence which Hamilton had not the heart to break after the\n",
      "two had gone, and it was Bones who uttered the first comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's that,\" he said, and his voice was so quiet and normal that\n",
      "Hamilton stared at him in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's have lunch,\" said Bones briskly, and led the way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not even when Miss Whitland came to him that afternoon and asked for\n",
      "permission to take two days' holiday did his manner change.  With a\n",
      "courtesy entirely free from that extravagance to which she had grown\n",
      "accustomed, he acceded to her request, and she was on the point of\n",
      "explaining to him the reason she had so unexpectedly asked for a\n",
      "vacation, but the memory of his earlier manner checked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very simple explanation.  Jackson Hyane was a very plausible\n",
      "man.  Marguerite Whitland had heard something of her erratic cousin,\n",
      "but certainly nothing in his manner supported the more lurid\n",
      "descriptions of his habits.  And Mr. Jackson Hyane had begged her, in\n",
      "the name of their relationships, to take a trip to Aberdeen to examine\n",
      "title-deeds which, he explained, would enable her to join with him in\n",
      "an action of the recovery of valuable Whitland property which was in\n",
      "danger of going to the Crown, and she had consented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, there had always been some talk in the family of these\n",
      "estates, though nobody knew better than Jackson Hyane how unsubstantial\n",
      "were the claims of the Whitlands to the title.  But the Scottish estate\n",
      "had been docketed away in the pigeon-holes of his mind, and promised to\n",
      "be more useful than he had anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "That afternoon he packed his bag at his flat, put his passport and\n",
      "railway tickets together in his inside pocket, and made his final\n",
      "preparations for departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "An old crony of his called whilst he was drinking the cup of tea which\n",
      "the housekeeper of the flats had prepared, and took in the situation\n",
      "revealed by the packed suit-cases and the burnt papers in the hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Johnny!\" he said.  \"You're getting out, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson nodded.  There was no need to pretend anything with one of his\n",
      "own class.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you square the bank?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Billy,\" he said cheerfully, \"I couldn't square it.  At this\n",
      "identical moment there are several eminent people in the West End of\n",
      "London who are making applications for warrants.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dud cheques, eh?\" asked the other thoughtfully.  \"Well, it had to\n",
      "come, Johnny.  You've had a lot of bad luck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Atrocious,\" said Mr. Jackson Hyane.  \"There's plenty of money in Town,\n",
      "but it's absolutely impossible to get at it.  I haven't touched a mug\n",
      "for two months, and I've backed more seconds than I care to think\n",
      "about.  Still,\" he mused, \"there's a chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His friends nodded.  In their circle there was always \"a chance,\" but\n",
      "he could not guess that that chance which the student of men, Mr.\n",
      "Jackson Hyane, was banking upon answered indifferently to the name of\n",
      "Tibbetts or Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past eight that night he saw his cousin off from King's Cross.\n",
      "He had engaged a sleeper for her, and acted the part of dutiful\n",
      "relative to the life, supplying her with masses of literature to while\n",
      "away the sleepless hours of the journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel awfully uncomfortable about going away,\" said the girl, in a\n",
      "troubled voice.  \"Mr. Tibbetts would say that he could spare me even if\n",
      "he were up to his eyes in work.  And I have an uncomfortable feeling at\n",
      "the back of my mind that there was something I should have told\n",
      "him--and didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Queer bird, Tibbetts!\" said the other curiously.  \"They call him\n",
      "Bones, don't they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never do,\" said the girl quietly; \"only his friends have that\n",
      "privilege.  He is one of the best men I have ever met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sentimental, quixotic, and all that sort of thing, eh?\" said Jackson,\n",
      "and the girl flushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has never been sentimental with me,\" she said, but did not deceive\n",
      "the student of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the train had left the station, he drove straightaway to\n",
      "Devonshire Street.  Bones was in his study, reading, or pretending to\n",
      "read, and the last person he expected to see that evening was Mr.\n",
      "Jackson Hyane.  But the welcome he gave to that most unwelcome visitor\n",
      "betrayed neither his distrust nor his frank dislike of the young\n",
      "well-groomed man in evening-dress who offered him his hand with such a\n",
      "gesture of good fellowship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, Mr.--er----\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a cold, cold feeling at his heart, a sense of coming\n",
      "disaster, but Bones facing the real shocks and terrors of life was a\n",
      "different young man from the Bones who fussed and fumed over its\n",
      "trifles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you wonder why I have come to see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said\n",
      "Hyane, taking a cigarette from the silver box on the table.  \"I rather\n",
      "wonder why I have the nerve to see you myself.  I've come on a very\n",
      "delicate matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" said Bones a little huskily, and he knew instinctively what\n",
      "that delicate matter was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is about Marguerite,\" said Mr. Hyane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones inclined his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, we have been great pals all our lives,\" went on Jackson\n",
      "Hyane, pulling steadily at the cigarette--\"in fact, sweethearts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His keen eyes never left the other's face, and he read all he wanted to\n",
      "know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am tremendously fond of Marguerite,\" he went on, \"and I think I am\n",
      "not flattering myself when I say that Marguerite is tremendously fond\n",
      "of me.  I haven't been especially fortunate, and I have never had the\n",
      "money which would enable me to offer Marguerite the kind of life which\n",
      "a girl so delicately nurtured should have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very admirable,\" said Bones, and his voice came to his own ears as the\n",
      "voice of a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A few days ago,\" Mr. Hyane went on, \"I was offered a tea plantation\n",
      "for fourteen thousand pounds.  The prospects were so splendid that I\n",
      "went to a financier who is a friend of mine, and he undertook to\n",
      "provide the money, on which, of course, I agreed to pay an interest.\n",
      "The whole future, which had been so black, suddenly became as bright as\n",
      "day.  I came to Marguerite, as you saw, with the news of my good luck,\n",
      "and asked her if she would be my wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones said nothing; his face was a mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now I come to my difficulty, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane.  \"This\n",
      "afternoon Marguerite and I played upon you a little deception which I\n",
      "hope you will forgive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, certainly\" mumbled Bones, and gripped the arms of his chair\n",
      "the tighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I took Marguerite to lunch to-day,\" said Hyane, \"it was to\n",
      "be--married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Married!\" repeated Bones dully, and Mr. Hyane nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we were married at half-past one o'clock to-day at the Marylebone\n",
      "Registry Office, and I was hoping that Marguerite would be able to tell\n",
      "you her good news herself.  Perhaps\"--he smiled--\"it isn't as good news\n",
      "to her as it is to me.  But this afternoon a most tragic thing\n",
      "happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw away his cigarette, rose, and paced the room with agitated\n",
      "strides.  He had practised those very strides all that morning, for he\n",
      "left nothing to chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At three o'clock this afternoon I called upon my financier friend, and\n",
      "discovered that, owing to heavy losses which he had incurred on the\n",
      "Stock Exchange, he was unable to keep his promise.  I feel terrible,\n",
      "Mr. Tibbetts!  I feel that I have induced Marguerite to marry me under\n",
      "false pretences.  I had hoped to-morrow morning to have gone to the\n",
      "agents of the estate and placed in their hands the cheque for fourteen\n",
      "thousand pounds, and to have left by the next mail boat for India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sank into the chair, his head upon his hands, and Bones watched him\n",
      "curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, and after an effort, Bones found his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does your--your--wife know?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he groaned, \"that's the terrible thing about it.  She hasn't the\n",
      "slightest idea.  What shall I tell her?  What shall I tell her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's pretty rotten, old--Mr. Hyane.\"  Bones found his voice after a\n",
      "while.  \"Deuced rotten for the young miss--for Mrs.--for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not move from his chair, nor relax his stiff expression.  He was\n",
      "hurt beyond his own understanding, frantically anxious to end the\n",
      "interview, but at a loss to find an excuse until his eyes fell upon the\n",
      "clock over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come back at ten--no, half-past ten, young Mr. ... awfully busy now\n",
      "... see you at half-past ten, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hyane made a graceful exit, and left Bones alone with the shattered\n",
      "fragments of great romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that was why she had gone off in such a hurry, and she had not dared\n",
      "to tell him.  But why not?  He was nothing to her ... he would never\n",
      "see her again!  The thought made him cold.  Never again!  Never again!\n",
      "He tried to summon that business fortitude of his, of which he was so\n",
      "proud.  He wanted some support, some moral support in this moment of\n",
      "acute anguish.  Incidentally he wanted to cry, but didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "She ought to have given him a week's notice, he told himself fiercely,\n",
      "than laughed hysterically at the thought.  He considered the matter\n",
      "from all its aspects and every angle, and was no nearer to peace of\n",
      "mind when, at half-past ten to the second, Mr. Jackson Hyane returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bones had formed one definite conclusion, and had settled upon the\n",
      "action he intended taking.  Mr. Hyane, entering the study, saw the\n",
      "cheque book on the desk, and was cheered.  Bones had to clear his voice\n",
      "several times before he could articulate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Hyane,\" he said huskily, \"I have been thinking matters out.  I am\n",
      "a great admirer of yours--of your--of yours--a tremendous admirer of\n",
      "yours, Mr. Hyane.  Anything that made her happy, old Mr. Hyane, would\n",
      "make me happy.  You see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see,\" said Mr. Hyane, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that\n",
      "he, a student of men, had not misread his victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fourteen thousand pounds,\" said Bones, turning abruptly to the desk\n",
      "and seizing his pen.  \"Make it payable to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're too kind,\" murmured Hyane.  \"Make it an open cheque, Mr.\n",
      "Tibbetts--I have to pay the agents in cash.  These Indian merchants are\n",
      "so suspicious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones wrote the cheque rapidly, marked it \"Pay Cash,\" and initialled\n",
      "the corrections, then tore the slip from the book and handed it to the\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane reverentially, \"I regard half\n",
      "this as a loan to me and half as a loan to my dear wife.  We shall\n",
      "never forget your kindness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rot!\" said Bones.  \"Nonsense!  I hope you'll be happy, and will you\n",
      "tell her----\"  He swallowed something.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a faint tinkle of a bell in the hall, and Ali, his servant,\n",
      "poked an ebony face round the corner of the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" he said, \"the telephonic apparatus demands conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones was glad of the interruption, and, with a muttered apology to his\n",
      "gratified guest, he strode out into the hall.  Ali had accustomed\n",
      "himself to answering the telephone, but this time he had not understood\n",
      "the preliminary inquiry from exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\" said Bones into the transmitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sound of the voice which answered him he nearly dropped the\n",
      "receiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that Mr. Tibbetts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Bones hoarsely, and his heart beat a wild rataplan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm speaking from York, Mr. Tibbetts.  I wanted to tell you that the\n",
      "key of the safe is in the drawer of my desk--the top drawer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's all right, dear old--dear Mrs. Hyane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that you say?\" asked the voice sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Congratulations, dear old missus,\" said Bones.  \"Hope you'll be\n",
      "awfully happy on your plantation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" asked the voice.  \"Did you call me Mrs. Hyane?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Bones huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How ridiculous you are!  Did you really think I would ever marry my\n",
      "cousin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But haven't you?\" yelled Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What--married?  Absurd!  I'm going to Scotland to see about some\n",
      "family matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not--not a Mrs.?\" asked Bones emphatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And never will be,\" said the girl.  \"What does it all mean?  Tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones drew a long breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come back by the next train, young miss,\" he said.  \"Let that jolly\n",
      "old family affair go to blazes.  I'll meet you at the station and tell\n",
      "you everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--but----\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do as you're told, young miss!\" roared Bones, and hung up the receiver\n",
      "with a seraphic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of his study was a thick one, and it was, moreover, protected\n",
      "from outside noises by a large baize door, and the student of men had\n",
      "heard nothing.  Bones strode back into the room with a face so changed\n",
      "that Mr. Hyane could not but observe that something remarkable had\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I'm keeping you up, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"Let's have a look at that cheque\n",
      "I gave you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me have a look at it,\" said Bones, and Mr. Hyane, with a smile,\n",
      "took it from his pocket and handed it to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Half for you and half for her, eh, dear old thing?\" said Bones, and\n",
      "tore the cheque in two.  \"That's your half,\" he said, handing one\n",
      "portion to Mr. Hyane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the devil are you doing?\" demanded the other angrily, but Bones\n",
      "had him by the collar, and was kicking him along the all-too-short\n",
      "corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open the door, Ali!\" said Bones.  \"Open it wide, dear old heathen!\n",
      "Ooff!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Ooff!\" was accompanied by one final lunge of Bones's long legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At midnight Bones was sitting on the platform at King's Cross,\n",
      "alternately smoking a large pipe and singing tuneless songs.  They told\n",
      "him that the next train from York would not arrive until three in the\n",
      "morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That doesn't worry me, old thing.  I'll wait all night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Expecting somebody, sir?\" asked the inquisitive porter.\n",

      "BONES HITS BACK\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be said of Bones that he was in the City, but not of it.  Never\n",
      "once had he been invited by the great and awe-inspiring men who\n",
      "dominate the finance of the City to participate in any of those\n",
      "adventurous undertakings which produce for the adventurers the fabulous\n",
      "profits about which so much has been written.  There were times when\n",
      "Bones even doubted whether the City knew he was in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never realised his own insignificance so poignantly as when he\n",
      "strolled through the City streets at their busiest hour, and was\n",
      "unrecognised even by the bareheaded clerks who dashed madly in all\n",
      "directions, carrying papers of tremendous importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indifference of the City to Mr. Tibbetts and his partner was more\n",
      "apparent than real.  It is true that the great men who sit around the\n",
      "green baize cloth at the Bank of England and arrange the bank rate knew\n",
      "not Bones nor his work.  It is equally true that the very important\n",
      "personages who occupy suites of rooms in Lombard Street had little or\n",
      "no idea of his existence.  But there were men, and rich and famous men\n",
      "at that, who had inscribed the name of Bones in indelible ink on the\n",
      "tablets of their memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pole Brothers were shipbrokers, and had little in common, in their\n",
      "daily transactions, with Mr. Harold de Vinne, who specialised in\n",
      "industrial stocks, and knew little more about ships than could be\n",
      "learnt in an annual holiday trip to Madeira.  Practically there was no\n",
      "bridge to connect their intellects.  Sentimentally, life held a common\n",
      "cause, which they discovered one day, when Mr. Fred Pole met Mr. Harold\n",
      "de Vinne at lunch to discuss a matter belonging neither to the realms\n",
      "of industrialism nor the mercantile marine, being, in fact, the\n",
      "question of Mr. de Vinne leasing or renting Mr. Pole's handsome\n",
      "riverside property at Maidenhead for the term of six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "They might not have met even under these circumstances, but for the\n",
      "fact that some dispute arose as to who was to pay the gardener.  That\n",
      "matter had been amicably settled, and the two had reached the coffee\n",
      "stage of their luncheon, when Mr. de Vinne mentioned the\n",
      "inadvisability--as a rule--of discussing business matters at lunch, and\n",
      "cited a deplorable happening when an interested eavesdropper had\n",
      "overheard certain important negotiations and had most unscrupulously\n",
      "taken advantage of his discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of these days,\" said Mr. de Vinne between his teeth, \"I'll be even\n",
      "with that gentleman.\"  (He did not call him a gentleman.)  \"I'll give\n",
      "him Tibbetts!  He'll be sorry he was ever born.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tibbetts?\" said Mr. Fred Pole, sitting bolt upright.  \"Not Bones?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other nodded and seemed surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know the dear fellow, do you?\" he asked, only he did not use\n",
      "the expression \"dear fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know him?\" said Mr. Fred, taking a long breath.  \"I should jolly well\n",
      "say I did know him.  And my brother Joe knows him.  That fellow----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That fellow----\" began Mr. de Vinne, and for several minutes they\n",
      "talked together in terms which were uncomplimentary to Augustus\n",
      "Tibbetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared, though they did not put the matter so crudely, that they\n",
      "had both been engaged in schemes for robbing Bones, and that in the\n",
      "pursuance of their laudable plans they had found themselves robbed by\n",
      "Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. de Vinne ordered another coffee and prepared to make an afternoon\n",
      "of it.  They discussed Bones from several aspects and in various\n",
      "lights, none of which revealed his moral complexion at its best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And believe me,\" said Mr. de Vinne at the conclusion of his address\n",
      "for the prosecution, \"there's money to be made out of that fellow.\n",
      "Why, I believe he has three hundred thousand pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three hundred and forty thousand,\" said the more accurate Mr. Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A smart man could get it all,\" said Harold de Vinne, with conviction.\n",
      "\"And when I say a smart man, I mean two smart men.  I never thought\n",
      "that he had done anybody but me.  It's funny I never heard of your\n",
      "case,\" he said.  \"He must have got the best of you in the early days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was his first\"--he swallowed hard and added--\"mug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. de Vinne pulled thoughtfully at his black cigar and eyed the\n",
      "ceiling of the restaurant absent-mindedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's nobody in the City who knows more about Tibbetts than me,\" he\n",
      "said.  He was weak on the classical side, but rather strong on\n",
      "mathematics.  \"I've watched every transaction he's been in, and I think\n",
      "I have got him down fine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mind you,\" said Fred, \"I think he's clever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clever!\" said the other scornfully.  \"Clever!  He's lucky, my dear\n",
      "chap.  Things have just fallen into his lap.  It's mug's luck that man\n",
      "has had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred nodded.  It was an opinion which he himself had held and\n",
      "ruminated upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is luck--sheer luck,\" continued Mr. de Vinne.  \"And if we'd been\n",
      "clever, we'd have cleaned him.  We'll clean him yet,\" he said, stroking\n",
      "his chin more thoughtfully than ever, \"but it's got to be done\n",
      "systematically.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred was interested.  The possibility of relieving a\n",
      "fellow-creature of his superfluous wealth by legitimate means, and\n",
      "under the laws and rules which govern the legal transfer of property,\n",
      "was the absorbing interest of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has got to be done cleverly, scientifically, and systematically,\"\n",
      "said Mr. de Vinne, \"and there's no sense in jumping to a plan.  What do\n",
      "you say to taking a bit of dinner with me at the Ritz-Carlton on\n",
      "Friday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred was very agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you the strength of Bones,\" said de Vinne, as they left the\n",
      "restaurant.  \"He was an officer on the West Coast of Africa.  His boss\n",
      "was a man named Sanders, who's left the Service and lives at\n",
      "Twickenham.  From what I can hear, this chap Tibbetts worships the\n",
      "ground that Sanders walks on.  Evidently Sanders was a big bug in West\n",
      "Africa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday they resumed their conversation, and Mr. de Vinne arrived\n",
      "with a plan.  It was a good plan.  He was tremulous with pride at the\n",
      "thought of it, and demanded applause and approval with every second\n",
      "breath, which was unlike him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of many companies, good, bad, and indifferent, and,\n",
      "reviewing the enterprises with which his name was associated, he had,\n",
      "without the slightest difficulty, placed his finger upon the least\n",
      "profitable and certainly the most hopeless proposition in the Mazeppa\n",
      "Trading Company.  And nothing could be better for Mr. de Vinne's\n",
      "purpose, not, as he explained to Fred Pole, if he had searched the\n",
      "Stock Exchange Year Book from cover to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time the Mazeppa Trading Company had been a profitable\n",
      "concern.  Its trading stores had dotted the African hinterland thickly.\n",
      "It had exported vast quantities of Manchester goods and Birmingham\n",
      "junk, and had received in exchange unlimited quantities of rubber and\n",
      "ivory.  But those were in the bad old days, before authority came and\n",
      "taught the aboriginal natives the exact value of a sixpenny\n",
      "looking-glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "No longer was it possible to barter twenty pounds' worth of ivory for\n",
      "threepennyworth of beads, and the flourishing Mazeppa Trading Company\n",
      "languished and died.  Its managers had grown immensely wealthy from\n",
      "their peculations and private trading, and had come home and were\n",
      "occupying opulent villas at Wimbledon, whilst the new men who had been\n",
      "sent to take their places had been so inexperienced that profits fell\n",
      "to nothing.  That, in brief, was the history of the Mazeppa Trading\n",
      "Company, which still maintained a few dilapidated stores, managed by\n",
      "half-castes and poor whites.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I got most of the shares for a song,\" confessed Mr. de Vinne.  \"In\n",
      "fact, I happen to be one of the debenture-holders, and stepped in when\n",
      "things were going groggy.  We've been on the point of winding it up--it\n",
      "is grossly over-capitalised--but I kept it going in the hope that\n",
      "something would turn up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the general idea?\" asked Mr. Fred Pole, interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll get a managing director,\" said Mr. de Vinne solemnly.  \"A man\n",
      "who is used to the handling of natives, a man acquainted with the West\n",
      "Coast of Africa, a man who can organise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones?\" suggested Mr. Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bones be--jiggered!\" replied de Vinne scornfully.  \"Do you think he'd\n",
      "fall for that sort of thing?  Not on your life!  We're not going to\n",
      "mention it to Bones.  But he has a pal--Sanders; you've heard of him.\n",
      "He's a commissioner or something on the West Coast, and retired.  Now,\n",
      "my experience of a chap of that kind who retires is that he gets sick\n",
      "to death of doing nothing.  If we could only get at him and persuade\n",
      "him to accept the managing directorship, with six months a year on the\n",
      "Coast, at a salary of, say, two thousand a year, conditional on taking\n",
      "up six or seven thousand pounds' worth of shares, what do you think\n",
      "would happen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred's imagination baulked at the problem, and he shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you what would happen,\" said Mr. de Vinne.  \"It happened\n",
      "once before, when another pal of Bones got let in on a motor car\n",
      "company.  Bones fell over himself to buy the shares and control the\n",
      "company.  And, mind you, the Mazeppa looks good.  It's the sort of\n",
      "proposition that would appeal to a young and energetic man.  It's one\n",
      "of those bogy companies that seem possible, and a fellow who knows the\n",
      "ropes would say straight away: 'If I had charge of that, I'd make it\n",
      "pay.'  That's what I'm banking on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are the shares worth?\" said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About twopence net,\" replied the other brutally.  \"I'll tell you\n",
      "frankly that I'd run this business myself if I thought there was any\n",
      "chance of my succeeding.  But if Bones finds all the shares in one\n",
      "hand, he's going to shy.  What I'm prepared to do is this.  These\n",
      "shares are worth twopence.  I'm going to sell you and a few friends\n",
      "parcels at a shilling a share.  If nothing happens, I'll undertake to\n",
      "buy them back at the same price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later Hamilton brought news to the office of Tibbetts and\n",
      "Hamilton, Limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The chief is going back to the Coast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones opened his mouth wide in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Back to the Coast?\" he said incredulously.  \"You don't mean he's\n",
      "chucking jolly old Twickenham?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's had an excellent offer from some people in the City to control a\n",
      "trading company.  By the way, did you ever hear of the Mazeppa\n",
      "Company?\" Bones shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've heard of Mazeppa,\" he said.  \"He was the naughty old gentleman\n",
      "who rode through the streets of Birmingham without any clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I had your knowledge of history,\" he said despairingly, \"I'd start\n",
      "a bone factory.  You're thinking of Lady Godiva, but that doesn't\n",
      "matter.  No, I don't suppose you've heard of the Mazeppa Company; it\n",
      "did not operate in our territory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones shook his head and pursed his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But surely,\" he said, \"dear old Excellency hasn't accepted a job\n",
      "without consulting me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton made derisive noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He fixed it up in a couple of days,\" he said, after a while.  \"It\n",
      "doesn't mean he'll be living on the Coast, but he'll probably be there\n",
      "for some months in the year.  The salary is good--in fact, it's two\n",
      "thousand a year.  I believe Sanders has to qualify for directorship by\n",
      "taking some shares, but the dear chap is enthusiastic about it, and so\n",
      "is Patricia.  It is all right, of course.  Sanders got the offer\n",
      "through a firm of solicitors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooh!\" said Bones.  \"Solicitors are nobody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He learnt more about the company that afternoon, for Sanders called in\n",
      "and gave a somewhat roseate view of the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fact is, Bones, I am getting stale,\" he said, \"and this looks like\n",
      "an excellent and a profitable occupation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you get to hear about it, Excellency?\".  asked Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attitude was one of undisguised antagonism.  He might have been a\n",
      "little resentful that the opportunity had come to Sanders through any\n",
      "other agency than his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a letter from the solicitors asking me if the idea appealed to\n",
      "me, and recalling my services on the Coast,\" said Sanders.  \"Of course\n",
      "I know very little about the Mazeppa Trading Company, though I had\n",
      "heard of it years gone past as a very profitable concern.  The\n",
      "solicitors were quite frank, and told me that business had fallen off,\n",
      "due to inexperienced management.  They pointed out the opportunities\n",
      "which existed--the possibilities of opening new stations--and I must\n",
      "confess that it appealed to me.  It will mean hard work, but the salary\n",
      "is good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold hard, Sir and Excellency,\" said Bones.  \"What did you have to put\n",
      "up in the way of shares?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders flushed.  He was a shy man, and not given to talking about his\n",
      "money affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, about five thousand pounds,\" he said awkwardly.  \"Of course, it's\n",
      "a lot of money; but even if the business isn't successful, I have a\n",
      "five-year contract with the company, and I get more than my investment\n",
      "back in salary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That night Bones stayed on after Hamilton had left, and had for\n",
      "companion Miss Marguerite Whitland, a lady in whose judgment he had a\n",
      "most embarrassing faith.  He had given her plenty of work to do, and\n",
      "the rhythmical tap-tap of her typewriter came faintly through the door\n",
      "which separated the outer from the inner office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones sat at his desk, his chin in his hand, a very thoughtful young\n",
      "man, and before him was a copy of the latest evening newspaper, opened\n",
      "at the Stock Exchange page.  There had been certain significant\n",
      "movements in industrial shares--a movement so interesting to the\n",
      "commentator upon Stock Exchange doings that he had inserted a paragraph\n",
      "to the effect that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The feature of the industrial market was the firmness of Mazeppa\n",
      "Trading shares, for which there was a steady demand, the stock closing\n",
      "at 19_s_. 9_d_.  Mazeppa shares have not been dealt in within the House\n",
      "for many years, and, in fact, it was generally believed that the\n",
      "Company was going into liquidation, and the shares could be had for the\n",
      "price of the paper on which they were printed.  It is rumoured in the\n",
      "City that the Company is to be reconstructed, and that a considerable\n",
      "amount of new capital has been found, with the object of expanding its\n",
      "existing business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones read the paragraph many times, and at the conclusion of each\n",
      "reading returned to his reverie.  Presently he rose and strolled into\n",
      "the office of his secretary, and the girl looked up with a smile as\n",
      "Bones seated himself on the edge of her table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young miss,\" he said soberly, \"do you ever hear anybody talking about\n",
      "me in this jolly old City?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, yes,\" she said in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fearfully complimentarily, dear old miss?\" asked Bones carelessly, and\n",
      "the girl's colour deepened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think it matters what people say about one, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't matter to me,\" said Bones, \"so long as one lovely old\n",
      "typewriter has a good word for poor old Bones.\"  He laid his hand upon\n",
      "hers, and she suffered it to remain there without protest.  \"They think\n",
      "I'm a silly old ass, don't they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" she said quickly, \"they don't think that.  They say you're\n",
      "rather unconventional.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Same thing,\" said Bones.  \"Anybody who's unconventional in business is\n",
      "a silly old ass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He squeezed the hand under his, and again she did not protest or\n",
      "withdraw it from his somewhat clammy grip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old darling----\" began Bones, but she stopped him with a warning\n",
      "finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old typewriter,\" said Bones, unabashed, but obedient, \"suppose\n",
      "something happened to the clever old Johnny who presides over this\n",
      "office--the brains of the department, if I may be allowed to say so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Hamilton?\" said the girl in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, me,\" said Bones, annoyed.  \"Gracious Heavens, dear old key-tapper,\n",
      "didn't I say me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something happen to you?\" she said in alarm.  \"Why, what could happen\n",
      "to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose I went broke?\" said Bones, with the comfortable air of one who\n",
      "was very unlikely to go broke.  \"Suppose I had terrific and tremendous\n",
      "and cataclysmic and what's-the-other-word losses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you're not likely to have those, are you?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not really,\" said Bones, \"but suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that, for once, when he was speaking to her, his mind was\n",
      "elsewhere, and withdrew her hand.  It was a fact that Bones did not\n",
      "seem to notice the withdrawal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor old Bones, poor old mug!\" said Bones softly.  \"I'm a funny old\n",
      "devil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what you're thinking about,\" she said, \"but you never\n",
      "strike me as being particularly funny, or poor, or old, for the matter\n",
      "of that,\" she added demurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones stooped down from the table and laid his big hand on her head,\n",
      "rumpling her hair as he might have done to a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a dear old Marguerite,\" he said softly, \"and I'm not such a\n",
      "ditherer as you think.  Now, you watch old Bones.\"  And, with that\n",
      "cryptic remark, he stalked back to his desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after this he surprised Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm expecting a visitor to-day, old Ham,\" he said.  \"A Johnny named de\n",
      "Vinne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De Vinne?\" frowned Hamilton.  \"I seem to know that name.  Isn't he the\n",
      "gentleman you had the trouble with over the boots?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the jolly old robber,\" said Bones cheerfully.  \"I've\n",
      "telegraphed and asked him to come to see me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About what?\" demanded Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About two o'clock,\" said Bones.  \"You can stay and see your old friend\n",
      "through, or you can let us have it out with the lad in camera.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll stay,\" said Hamilton.  \"But I don't think he'll come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Bones confidently, and he was justified in his confidence,\n",
      "for at two o'clock to the second Mr. de Vinne appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was bright and cheerful, even genial to Bones, and Bones was almost\n",
      "effusive in his welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down there in the most comfortable chair, happy old financier,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and open your young heart to old Bones about the Mazeppa Trading\n",
      "Company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. de Vinne did not expect so direct an attack, but recovered from his\n",
      "surprise without any apparent effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, so you know I was behind that, do you?  How the dickens did you\n",
      "find out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stock Exchange Year Book, dear old thing.  Costs umpteen and sixpence,\n",
      "and you can find out everything you want to know about the directors of\n",
      "companies,\" said Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jove!  That's clever of you,\" said de Vinne, secretly amused, for\n",
      "it was from the Year Book that he expected Bones to make the discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, what's the game, old financial gentleman?\" asked Bones.  \"Why\n",
      "this fabulous salary to friend Sanders and selling this thousands of\n",
      "pounds worth of shares, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear chap, it's a business transaction.  And really, if I thought\n",
      "you were going to interrogate me on that, I shouldn't have come.  Is\n",
      "Mr. Sanders a friend of yours?\" he asked innocently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shurrup!\" said Bones vulgarly.  \"You know jolly well he's a friend of\n",
      "mine.  Now, what is the idea, young company promoter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's pretty obvious,\" replied de Vinne, taking the expensive cigar\n",
      "which Bones had imported into the office for the purpose.  \"The\n",
      "position is a good one----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Half a mo',\" said Bones.  \"Do you personally guarantee Mr. Sanders's\n",
      "salary for five years?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not.  It is a company matter,\" he said, \"and I should\n",
      "certainly not offer a personal guarantee for the payment of any salary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that, if the company goes bust in six months' time, Mr. Sanders\n",
      "loses all the money he has invested and his salary?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other raised his shoulders again with a deprecating smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He would, of course, have a claim against the company for his salary,\"\n",
      "he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fat lot of good that would be!\" answered Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, look here, Mr. Tibbetts\"--the other leaned confidentially\n",
      "forward, his unlighted cigar between his teeth--\"there is no reason in\n",
      "the world why the Mazeppa Company shouldn't make a fortune for the\n",
      "right man.  All it wants is new blood and capable direction.  I\n",
      "confess,\" he admitted, \"that I have not the time to give to the\n",
      "company, otherwise I'd guarantee a seven per cent. dividend on the\n",
      "share capital.  Why, look at the price of them to-day----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones stopped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any fool can get the shares up to any price he likes, if they're all\n",
      "held in one hand,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" said the outraged Mr. de Vinne.  \"Do you suggest I have rigged\n",
      "the market?  Besides, they're not all in one hand.  They're pretty\n",
      "evenly distributed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who holds 'em?\" asked Bones curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've got a parcel, and Pole Brothers have a parcel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pole Brothers, eh?\" said Bones, nodding.  \"Well, well!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, now, be reasonable.  Don't be suspicious, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said\n",
      "the other genially.  \"Your friend's interests are all right, and the\n",
      "shareholders' interests are all right.  You might do worse than get\n",
      "control of the company yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking of that,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I assure you,\" said Mr. de Vinne with great earnestness, \"that the\n",
      "possibilities of the Mazeppa Trading Company are unlimited.  We have\n",
      "concessions from the Great River to the north of the French\n",
      "territory----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not worth the paper they're written on, dear old kidder,\" said Bones,\n",
      "shaking his head.  \"Chiefs' concessions without endorsement from the\n",
      "Colonial Office are no good, dear old thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the trading concessions are all right,\" insisted the other.  \"You\n",
      "can't deny that.  You understand the Coast customs better than I do.\n",
      "Trading customs hold without endorsement from the Colonial Office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones had to admit that that was a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll think it over,\" he said.  \"It appeals to me, old de Vinne.  It\n",
      "really does appeal to me.  Who own the shares?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can give you a list,\" said Mr. de Vinne, with admirable calm, \"and\n",
      "you'd be well advised to negotiate privately with these gentlemen.\n",
      "You'd probably get the shares for eighteen shillings.\"  He took a gold\n",
      "pencil from his pocket and wrote rapidly a list of names, and Bones\n",
      "took the paper from his hand and scrutinised them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton, a silent and an amazed spectator of the proceedings, waited\n",
      "until de Vinne had gone, and then fell upon his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not going to be such a perfect jackass----\" he began, but\n",
      "Bones's dignified gesture arrested his eloquence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old Ham,\" he said, \"senior partner, dear old thing!  Let old\n",
      "Bones have his joke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you realise,\" said Hamilton, \"that you are contemplating the risk\n",
      "of a quarter of a million?  You're mad, Bones!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones grinned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go down to our broker and buy ten thousand shares in old Mazeppa,\n",
      "Ham,\" he said.  \"You'll buy them on the market for nineteen shillings,\n",
      "and I've an idea that they're worth about the nineteenth part of a\n",
      "farthing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But----\" stammered Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is an order,\" said Bones, and he spoke in the Bomongo tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phew!\" said Hamilton.  \"That carries me a few thousand miles.  I\n",
      "wonder what those devils of the N'gombi are doing now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you something they're not doing,\" said Bones.  \"They're not\n",
      "buying Mazeppa shares.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two very deeply troubled people in the office of Tibbetts\n",
      "and Hamilton.  One was Hamilton himself, and the other was Miss\n",
      "Marguerite Whitland.  Hamilton had two causes for worry.  The first and\n",
      "the least was the strange extravagance of Bones.  The second--and this\n",
      "was more serious--was the prospect of breaking to Sanders that night\n",
      "that he had been swindled, for swindled he undoubtedly was.  Hamilton\n",
      "had spent a feverish hour canvassing City opinion on the Mazeppa\n",
      "Trading Company, and the report he had had was not encouraging.  He\n",
      "had, much against his will, carried out the instructions of Bones, and\n",
      "had purchased in the open market ten thousand shares in the Company--a\n",
      "transaction duly noted by Mr. de Vinne and his interested partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is biting,\" said that exultant man over the 'phone.  \"All we have\n",
      "to do is to sit steady, and he'll swallow the hook!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible that Marguerite Whitland should not know the extent\n",
      "of her employer's commitments.  She was a shrewd girl, and had acquired\n",
      "a very fair working knowledge of City affairs during the period of her\n",
      "employment.  She had, too, an instinct for a swindle, and she was\n",
      "panic-stricken at the thought that Bones was marching headlong to\n",
      "financial disaster.  Hamilton had gone home to his disagreeable task,\n",
      "when the girl came from her office and stood, her hands clasped behind\n",
      "her, before the desk of the senior partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones peered up in his short-sighted way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, young miss?\" he said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" she began a little unsteadily, \"I'm going to be very\n",
      "impertinent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" murmured Bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been with you for some time now,\" said the girl, speaking\n",
      "rapidly, \"and I feel that I have a better right to talk to you\n",
      "than--than----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Than anybody in the whole wide world,\" said Bones, \"and that's a fact,\n",
      "dear young Marguerite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" she said hurriedly, \"but this is something about business,\n",
      "and about--about this deal which you're going into.  I've been talking\n",
      "to Captain Hamilton this afternoon, while you were out, and I know it's\n",
      "a swindle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that, too,\" said Bones calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said the puzzled girl, \"you are putting all your money into it.\n",
      "Mr. Hamilton said that, if this failed, you might be ruined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones nodded.  Outwardly calm, the light of battle shone in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a gamble, dear young typewriter,\" he said, \"a terrific gamble,\n",
      "but it's going to turn out all right for did Bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mr. Hamilton said you can't possibly make anything from the\n",
      "property--that it is derelict and worth practically nothing.  Only a\n",
      "tenth of the stores are open, and the trading is----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bones smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not gambling on the property,\" he said softly.  \"Oh, dear, no,\n",
      "young fiancée, I'm not gambling on the property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what on earth are you gambling on?\" she asked, a little piqued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On me,\" said Bones in the same tone.  \"On poor old silly ass Bones,\n",
      "and I'm coming through!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and came across to her and laid his big hand on her shoulder\n",
      "gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I don't come through, I shan't be a beggar.  I shall have enough to\n",
      "build a jolly little place, where we can raise cows and horses and\n",
      "vegetables of all descriptions, dear old typewriter.  And if I do come\n",
      "through, we'll still have that same place--only perhaps we'll have more\n",
      "cows and a pig or two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed, and he raised her smiling lips to his and kissed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. de Vinne had dined well and had enjoyed an evening's amusement.  He\n",
      "had been to the Hippodrome, and his enjoyment had been made the more\n",
      "piquant by the knowledge that Mr. Augustus Tibbetts had as good as\n",
      "placed ten thousand pounds in his pocket.  He was a surprised man, on\n",
      "returning to Sloane Square, to discover, waiting in the hall, his\n",
      "unwilling benefactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"this is a great surprise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Bones, \"I suppose it is, old Mr. de Vinne.\"  And he coughed\n",
      "solemnly, as one who was the guardian of a great secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in,\" said Mr. de Vinne, more genial than ever.  \"This is my\n",
      "little den\"--indicating a den which the most fastidious of lions would\n",
      "not have despised.  \"Sit down and have a cigar, old man.  Now, what\n",
      "brings you here to-night?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The shares,\" said Bones soberly.  \"I've been worrying about the\n",

      "\n",

    "Let’s start by looking at the `open() function`. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The `open()` function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that is currently being executed is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function returns an object representing the file. Here, `open(file_name)` returns an object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`. Python stores this object in `file_object`, which we will work with later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `with` denotes a *Context Manager*, which essentially wraps a block of code and performs an action at the end of the block, no matter how it exits. In this case, it closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call `open()` in this program but not `close()`. You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` statement from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It is not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the time is right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a file object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`, we use the `read()` method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the **entire** text file back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because `read()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use `rstrip()`."

He was\\n', 'too much of a little gentleman to put his thoughts into words, but it\\n', 'came upon him like a flash that the money which Hamilton had invested\\n', 'in the Plover Light Car Company was every penny he possessed in the\\n', 'world, a little legacy he had received just before Bones had left the\\n', 'Coast, plus all his savings for years.\\n', '\\n', '\"Ham,\" he said hollowly, \"I am a jolly old rotter!

He prided himself upon\\n', 'coming to the point with the least possible delay.\\n', '\\n', 'The face of Mr. Soames fell.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, you want to buy a car?\" he said.  He might have truly said \"the\\n', 'car,\" but under the circumstances he thought that this would be\\n', 'tactless.\\n', '\\n', '\"No, dear old company promoter,\" said Bones, \"I do not want to buy your\\n', 'car.

In these days of aeroplane travel, when it is\\n', 'next to impossible to watch the comings and goings of important\\n', \"individuals, or even to get wind of directors' meetings, the City is\\n\", 'apt to be a little jumpy, and to respond to wild rumours in a fashion\\n', 'extremely trying to the nerves of conservative brokers.\\n', '\\n', 'There were rumours of a fusion of interests between the Franco-Persian\\n', 'Oil Company and the Petroleum Consolidated--rumours which set the\\n', 'shares of both concerns jumping up and down like two badly trained\\n', 'jazzers.

The\\n', 'extent of his immediate gains he inscribed in his private ledger; his\\n', 'ultimate and bigger balance he entered under a head which had nothing\\n', 'to do with the oil gamble--which was just like Bones, as Hamilton\\n', 'subsequently remarked.\\n', '\\n', 'Hamilton was staying with Sanders--late Commissioner of a certain group\\n', 'of Territories--and Bones was the subject of conversation one morning\\n', 'at breakfast.\\n', '\\n', 'The third at the table was an exceedingly pretty girl, whom the maid\\n', 'called \"Madame,\" and who opened several letters addressed to \"Mrs.\\n', 'Sanders,\" but who in days not long past had been known as Patricia\\n', 'Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', '\"Bones is wonderful,\" said Sanders, \"truly wonderful!

I've been studying him for the past month, and I'm\\n\", 'beginning to sense his method.  If he sees a logical and happy end to\\n', 'the romantic side of any new business, he takes it on.  He simply\\n', 'carries the business through on the back of a dream.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The girl looked up from the coffee-pot she was handling.\\n', '\\n', '\"Have you made up your mind, dear?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"About going in with Bones?\"  Hamilton smiled.  \"No, not yet.

Neatly printed above the picture were the\\n', 'words: \"Our Captains of Industry.  III.--Augustus Tibbetts, Esq.\\n', '(Schemes Limited).\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones read this with immense satisfaction.  He wondered who were the\\n', 'two men who could be placed before him, but in his generous mood was\\n', \"prepared to admit that he might come third in the list of London's\\n\", 'merchant princes.\\n', '\\n', '\"Deuced flattering, dear old thing,\" he murmured.  \"Hamilton, old boy,\\n', 'come and look at this.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Hamilton crossed to the desk, saw, and wondered.\\n', '\\n', '\"Not so bad,\" said Bones, dropping his head to one side and regarding\\n', 'the picture critically.  \"Not at all bad, dear old thing.  You\\'ve seen\\n', 'me in that mood, I think, old Ham.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What is the mood?\" said Hamilton innocently.  \"Indigestion?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The girl laughed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Let\\'s have a little light on the subject,\" said Bones.  \"Switch on the\\n', 'expensive old electricity, Ham.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, no,\" said the girl quickly.  \"I don\\'t think so.

Confound\\n', 'it all!  Hang it all, I say!  Dear old thing!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You can leave this picture, madam----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss,\" murmured Bones from force of habit.

He was twenty-four years of age, and\\n', 'he, too, had made the acquaintance of the Hindenburg Line.  Naturally\\n', 'Bones thought of Jelf when he purchased the _Flame_.\\n', '\\n', 'From the first Bones had run the _Flame_ with the object of exposing\\n', 'things.  He exposed Germans, Swedes, and Turks--which was safe.  He\\n', 'exposed a furniture dealer who had made him pay twice for an article\\n', 'because a receipt was lost, and that cost money.  He exposed a man who\\n', 'had been very rude to him in the City.  He would have exposed James\\n', 'Jacobus Jelf, only that individual showed such eagerness to expose his\\n', 'own shortcomings, at a guinea a column, that Bones had lost interest.\\n', '\\n', 'His stock of personal grievances being exhausted, he had gone in for a\\n', 'general line of exposure which embraced members of the aristocracy and\\n', 'the Stock Exchange.\\n', '\\n', \"If Bones did not like a man's face, he exposed him.

So Jelf told Bones with great earnestness.\\n', '\\n', '\"You know me, Tibbetts,\" he said.  \"I never speak about myself, and I\\'m\\n', 'rather inclined to disparage my own point of view than otherwise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve never noticed that,\" said Bones.\\n', '\\n', '\"You know, anyway,\" urged Jelf, \"that I want to see the bad side of\\n', 'anything I take up.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He explained how he had sat up night after night, endeavouring to\\n', 'discover some drawback to the Tibbetts-Jelf Lamp, and how he had rolled\\n', 'into bed at five in the morning, exhausted by the effort.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I could only find one flaw!\" he said.  \"But the ingenious beggar\\n', 'who invented it has not left a single bad point.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He went on to describe the lamp.  With the aid of a lead pencil and a\\n', \"piece of Bones's priceless notepaper he sketched the front elevation\\n\", 'and discoursed upon rays, especially upon ultra-violet rays.\\n', '\\n', 'Apparently this is a disreputable branch of the Ray family.  If you\\n', 'could only get an ultra-violet ray as he was sneaking out of the lamp,\\n', 'and hit him violently on the back of the head, you were rendering a\\n', 'service to science and humanity.\\n', '\\n', 'This lamp was so fixed that the moment Mr. Ultra V. Ray reached the\\n', 'threshold of freedom he was tripped up, pounced upon, and beaten until\\n', 'he (naturally enough) changed colour!\\n', '\\n', 'It was all done by the lens.\\n', '\\n', 'Jelf drew a Dutch cheese on the table-cloth to Illustrate the point.\\n', '\\n', '\"This light never goes out,\" said Jelf passionately.  \"If you lit it\\n', 'to-day, it would be alight to-morrow, and the next day, and so on.

But remember that Bones was the proprietor of a new\\n', 'motor-car, and thought motor-car and dreamed motor-car by day and by\\n', 'night.  Even as it was, he was framing a conventional expression of\\n', 'regret that he could not interest himself in outside property, when\\n', 'there dawned upon his mind the splendid possibilities of possessing\\n', 'this accessory, and he wavered.\\n', '\\n', '\"Anyway,\" he said, \"it will take a year to make.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Jelf beamed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Wrong!\" he cried triumphantly.  \"Two of the lamps are just finished,\\n', 'and will be ready to-morrow.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones hesitated.\\n', '\\n', '\"Of course, dear old Jelf,\" he said, \"I should like, as an experiment,\\n', 'to try them on my car.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"On your car?\"  Jelf stepped back a pace and looked at the other with\\n', 'very flattering interest and admiration.  \"Not your car!  _Have_ you a\\n', 'car?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones said he had a car, and explained it at length.  He even waxed as\\n', 'enthusiastic about his machine as had Mr. Jelf on the subject of the\\n', 'lamp that never went out.  And Jelf agreed with everything that Bones\\n', 'said.  Apparently he was personally acquainted with the Carter-Crispley\\n', 'car.  He had, so to speak, grown up with it.  He knew its good points\\n', 'and none of its bad points.  He thought the man who chose a car like\\n', 'that must have genius beyond the ordinary.  Bones agreed.  Bones had\\n', 'reached the conclusion that he had been mistaken about Jelf, and that\\n', 'possibly age had sobered him (it was nearly six months since he had\\n', 'perpetrated his last libel).  They parted the best of friends.  He had\\n', 'agreed to attend a demonstration at the workshop early the following\\n', 'morning, and Jelf, who was working on a ten per cent. commission basis,\\n', 'and had already drawn a hundred on account from the vendors, was there\\n', 'to meet him.\\n', '\\n', 'In truth it was a noble lamp--very much like other motor lamps, except\\n', 'that the bulb was, or apparently was, embedded in solid glass.  Its\\n', 'principal virtue lay in the fact that it carried its own accumulator,\\n', 'which had to be charged weekly, or the lamp forfeited its title.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Jelf explained, with the adeptness of an expert, how the lamp was\\n', 'controlled from the dashboard, and how splendid it was to have a light\\n', 'which was independent of the engine of the car or of faulty\\n', 'accumulators, and Bones agreed to try the lamp for a week.  He did more\\n', 'than this: he half promised to float a company for its manufacture, and\\n', 'gave Mr. Jelf fifty pounds on account of possible royalties and\\n', 'commission, whereupon Mr. Jelf faded from the picture, and from that\\n', 'moment ceased to take the slightest interest in a valuable article\\n', 'which should have been more valuable by reason of the fact that it bore\\n', 'his name.\\n', '\\n', 'Three days later Hamilton, walking to business, was overtaken by a\\n', 'beautiful blue Carter-Crispley, ornamented, it seemed from a distance,\\n', 'by two immense bosses of burnished silver.  On closer examination they\\n', 'proved to be nothing more remarkable than examples of the Tibbett-Jelf\\n', 'Lamp.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes,\" said Bones airily, \"that\\'s the lamp, dear old thing.  Invented\\n', 'in leisure hours by self and Jelf.  Step in, and I\\'ll explain.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Where do I step in,\" asked Hamilton, wilfully dense--\"into the car or\\n', 'into the lamp?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones patiently smiled and waved him with a gesture to a seat by his\\n', 'side.

I can even see that you\\'re driving with one hand.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones brought the other hand up quickly to the wheel and coughed.  As\\n', 'for Miss Marguerite Whitland, she laughed softly, but nobody heard her.\\n', '\\n', 'They were rushing along a country road tree-shaded and high-hedged, and\\n', 'Bones was singing a little song--when the light went out.\\n', '\\n', 'It went out with such extraordinary unexpectedness, without so much as\\n', 'a warning flicker, that he was temporarily blinded, and brought the car\\n', 'to a standstill.\\n', '\\n', '\"What\\'s up, Bones?\" asked Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', '\"The light, dear old thing,\" said Bones.  \"I think the jolly old\\n', 'typewriter must have touched the key with her knee.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed?\" said Hamilton politely; and Bones, remembering that the key\\n', 'was well over on his side of the car, coughed, this time fiercely.\\n', '\\n', 'He switched the key from left to right, but nothing happened.\\n', '\\n', '\"Most extraordinary!\" said Bones.\\n', '\\n', '\"Most,\" said Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a pause.\\n', '\\n', '\"I think the road branches off a little way up I\\'ll get down and see\\n', 'which is the right road to take,\" said Bones with sudden cheerfulness.\\n', '\"I remember seeing the old signpost before the--er--lamp went out.\\n', 'Perhaps, Miss Marguerite, you\\'d like to go for a little walk.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Marguerite Whitland said she thought she would, and they went off\\n', 'together to investigate, leaving Hamilton to speculate upon the\\n', 'likelihood of their getting home that night.\\n', '\\n', 'Bones walked ahead with Marguerite, and instinctively their hands\\n', 'sought and found one another.  They discovered the cross-roads, but\\n', 'Bones did not trouble to light his match.  His heart was beating with\\n', 'extraordinary violence, his lips were dry, he found much difficulty in\\n', 'speaking at all.\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Marguerite,\" he said huskily, \"don\\'t think I\\'m an awful outsider\\n', 'and a perfect rotter, dear old typewriter.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of course I don\\'t,\" she said a little faintly for Bones\\'s arm was\\n', 'about her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t think,\" said Bones, his voice trembling, \"that I am a naughty\\n', 'old philanderer; but somehow, dear old miss, being alone with you, and\\n', 'all that sort of stuff----\"\\n', '\\n', 'And he bent and kissed her, and at that moment the light that never\\n', 'went out came on again with extraordinary fierceness, as though to make\\n', 'up for its temporary absence without leave.\\n', '\\n', 'And these two young people were focused as in a limelight, and were not\\n', 'only visible from the car, but visible for miles around.\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear me!\" said Bones.\\n', '\\n', 'The girl said nothing.  She shaded her eyes from the light as she\\n', \"walked back.  As for Bones, he climbed into the driver's seat with the\\n\", 'deliberation of an old gentleman selecting a penny chair in the park,\\n', 'and said, without turning his head:\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s the road to the left.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m glad,\" said Hamilton, and made no comment even when Bones took the\\n', 'road to the right.\\n', '\\n', 'They had gone a quarter of a mile along this highway when the lamp went\\n', 'out.  It went out with as unexpected and startling suddenness as\\n', 'before.  Bones jingled the key, then turned.\\n', '\\n', '\"You wouldn\\'t like to get out, dear old Ham, and have a look round,\\n', 'would you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, Bones,\" said Hamilton drily.  \"We\\'re quite comfortable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You wouldn\\'t like to get down, my jolly old typewriter?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, thank you,\" said Miss Marguerite Whitland with decision.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh!\" said Bones.  \"Then, under the circumstances, dear old person,\\n', 'we\\'d all better sit here until----\"\\n', '\\n', 'At that moment the light came on.  It flooded the white road, and the\\n', 'white road was an excellent wind-screen against which the bending head\\n', 'of Bones was thrown into sharp relief.\\n', '\\n', 'The car moved on.  At regular intervals the light that never went out\\n', 'forsook its home-loving habits and took a constitutional.  The\\n', 'occupants of the ear came to regard its eccentricities with philosophy,\\n', 'even though it began to rain, and there was no hood.\\n', '\\n', 'On the outskirts of Guildford, Bones was pulled up by a policeman, who\\n', 'took his name because the lights were too bright.  On the other side of\\n', 'Guildford he was pulled up by another policeman because he had no light\\n', 'at all.  Passing through Kingston, the lamp began to flicker, sending\\n', 'forth brilliant dots and dashes, which continued until they were on\\n', \"Putney Common, where the lamp's message was answered from a camp of Boy\\n\", 'Scouts, one signalman of the troop being dragged from his bed for the\\n', 'purpose, the innocent child standing in his shirt at the call of duty.\\n', '\\n', '\"A delightful day,\" said Hamilton at parting that night.  (It was\\n', 'nearly twelve o\\'clock.)  \"I\\'m sorry you\\'ve had so much trouble with\\n', 'that lamp, Bones.  What did you call it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I say, old fellow,\" said Bones, ignoring the question, \"I hope, when\\n', \"you saw me picking a spider off dear old Miss Marguerite's shoulder,\\n\", 'you didn\\'t--er--think anything?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The only thing I thought was,\" said Hamilton, \"that I didn\\'t see the\\n', 'spider.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t stickle, dear old partner,\" said Bones testily.  \"It may have\\n', 'been an earwig.

Do you think I ought\\n\", 'to----\"  He paused, but his voice was eager.\\n', '\\n', '\"That,\" said Hamilton, \"is purely a question for the lady.  Now, what\\n', 'are you going to do with this lamp.  Are you going to float it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones scowled at the glaring headlight.\\n', '\\n', '\"That depends whether the naughty old things float, Ham,\" he said\\n', 'venomously.  \"If you think they will, my old eye-witness, how about\\n', 'tyin\\' a couple of bricks round \\'em before I chuck \\'em in.

Some--and they were few--cost him both.\\n', '\\n', 'Somewhere in a marine store in London lie the battered wrecks of what\\n', 'were once electro-plated motor-lamps of a peculiar and, to Bones,\\n', 'sinister design.  They were all that was left of a great commercial\\n', 'scheme, based upon the flotation of a lamp that never went out.\\n', '\\n', \"On a day of crisis in Bones's life they had gone out, which was bad.\\n\", 'They had come on at an inconvenient moment, which was worse, since they\\n', 'had revealed him and his secretary in tender attitudes.  And Bones had\\n', 'gone gaily to right the wrong, and had been received with cold\\n', 'politeness by the lady concerned.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a week of gloom, when Bones adopted towards his invaluable\\n', 'assistant the air and manner of one who was in the last stages of a\\n', \"wasting disease.  Miss Marguerite Whitland never came into Bones's\\n\", 'office without finding him sitting at his desk with his head in his\\n', \"hands, except once, when she came in without knocking and Bones hadn't\\n\", 'the time to strike that picturesque attitude.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, throughout that week she never saw him but he was swaying, or\\n', 'standing with his hand before his eyes, or clutching on to the edge of\\n', 'a chair, or walking with feeble footsteps; and she never spoke to him\\n', 'but he replied with a tired, wan smile, until she became seriously\\n', 'alarmed, thinking his brain was affected, and consulted Captain\\n', 'Hamilton, his partner.\\n', '\\n', '\"Look here, Bones, you miserable devil,\" said Hamilton, \"you\\'re scaring\\n', 'that poor girl.  What the dickens do you mean by it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Scaring who?\" said Bones, obviously pleased.  \"Am I really?  Is she\\n', 'fearfully cut up, dear old thing?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She is,\" said Hamilton truthfully.  \"She thinks you\\'re going dotty.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Vulgarity, vulgarity, dear old officer,\" said Bones, much annoyed.\\n', '\\n', '\"I told her you were often like that,\" Hamilton went on wilfully.  \"I\\n', 'said that you were a little worse, if anything, after your last love\\n', 'affair----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Heavens!\" nearly screamed Bones.  \"You didn\\'t tell her anything about\\n', 'your lovely old sister Patricia?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not,\" said Hamilton.  \"I merely pointed out to her the fact that\\n', 'when you were in love you were not to be distinguished from one whom is\\n', 'the grip of measles.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then you\\'re a naughty old fellow,\" said Bones.  \"You\\'re a wicked old\\n', \"rascal.  I'm surprised at you!  Can't a fellow have a little heart\\n\", 'trouble----\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Heart?  Bah!\" said Hamilton scornfully.\\n', '\\n', '\"Heart trouble,\" repeated Bones sternly.  \"I\\'ve always had a weak\\n', 'heart.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And a weak head, too,\" said Hamilton.  \"Now, just behave yourself,\\n', \"Bones, and stop frightening the lady.  I'm perfectly sure she's fond of\\n\", 'you--in a motherly kind of way,\" he added, as he saw Bones\\'s face light\\n', 'up.  \"And, really, she is such an excellent typist that it would be a\\n', 'sin and a shame to frighten her from the office.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This possibility had not occurred to Bones, and it is likely it had\\n', 'more effect than any other argument which Hamilton could use.  That day\\n', 'he began to take an interest in life, stepped gaily into the office and\\n', \"as blithely into his secretary's room.  He even made jokes, and dared\\n\", 'invite her to tea--an invitation which was declined so curtly that\\n', 'Bones decided that tea was an unnecessary meal, and cut it out\\n', 'forthwith.\\n', '\\n', 'All this time the business of Schemes Limited was going forward, if not\\n', 'by leaps and bounds, yet by steady progression.  Perhaps it was the\\n', 'restraining influence that Hamilton exercised which prevented the leaps\\n', 'being too pronounced and kept the bounds within bounds, so to speak.\\n', 'It was Schemes Limited which bought the theatrical property of the late\\n', 'Mr. Liggeinstein and re-sold those theatres in forty-eight hours at a\\n', 'handsome profit.  It was Bones who did the buying, and it was Hamilton\\n', 'who did the selling--in this case, to the intense annoyance of Bones,\\n', 'who had sat up the greater part of one night writing a four-act play in\\n', 'blank verse, and arriving at the office late, had discovered that his\\n', 'chance of acting as his own producer had passed for ever.\\n', '\\n', '\"And I\\'d written a most wonderful part for you, dear old mademoiselle,\"\\n', 'he said sadly to his secretary.  \"The part where you die in the third\\n', 'act--well, really, it brought tears to my jolly old eyes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think Captain Hamilton was very wise to accept the offer of the\\n', 'Colydrome Syndicate,\" said the girl coldly.\\n', '\\n', 'In his leisure moments Bones had other relaxations than the writing of\\n', 'poetry--now never mentioned--or four-act tragedies.  What Hamilton had\\n', 'said of him was true.  He had an extraordinary nose for a bargain, and\\n', 'found his profits in unexpected places.\\n', '\\n', 'People got to know him--quite important people, men who handled\\n', 'millions carelessly, like Julius Bohea, and Important Persons whose\\n', 'faces are familiar to the people of Britain, such as the Right Hon.\\n', 'George Parkinson Chenney.  Bones met that most influential member of\\n', 'the Cabinet at a very superior dinner-party, where everybody ate\\n', \"plovers' eggs as though it were a usual everyday occurrence.\\n\", '\\n', 'And Mr. Parkinson Chenney talked on his favourite subject with great\\n', 'ease and charm, and his favourite subject was the question of the\\n', 'Chinese Concession.  Apparently everybody had got concessions in China\\n', 'except the British, until one of our cleverest diplomatists stepped in\\n', 'and procured for us the most amazingly rich coalfield of Wei-hai-tai.\\n', 'The genius and foresight of this diplomatist--who had actually gone to\\n', 'China in the Long Vacation, and of his own initiative and out of his\\n', 'own head had evolved these concessions, which were soon to be ratified\\n', 'by a special commission which was coming from China--was a theme on\\n', 'which Mr. Parkinson Chenney spoke with the greatest eloquence.  And\\n', 'everybody listened respectfully, because he was a great man.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is not for me,\" said Mr. Parkinson Chenney, toying with the stem of\\n', 'his champagne glass and closing his eyes modestly, \"I say it is not for\\n', 'me--thank you, Perkins, I will have just as much as will come up to the\\n', 'brim; thank you, that will do very nicely--to speak boastfully or to\\n', 'enlarge unduly upon what I regard as a patriotic effort, and one which\\n', 'every citizen of these islands would in the circumstances have made,\\n', 'but I certainly plume myself upon the acumen and knowledge of the\\n', 'situation which I showed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hear, hear!\" said Bones in the pause that followed, and Mr. Parkinson\\n', 'Chenney beamed.\\n', '\\n', 'When the dinner was over, and the guests retired to the smoking-room,\\n', 'Bones buttonholed the minister.\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear old right honourable,\" said Bones, \"may I just have a few words\\n', 'in _re_ Chinese coal?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The right honourable gentleman listened, or appeared to listen.  Then\\n', 'Mr. Parkinson Chenney smiled a recognition to another great man, and\\n', 'moved off, leaving Bones talking.\\n', '\\n', 'Bones that night was the guest of a Mr. Harold Pyeburt, a City\\n', 'acquaintance--almost, it seemed, a disinterested City acquaintance.\\n', 'When Bones joined his host, Mr. Pyeburt patted him on the back.\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Tibbetts,\" he said in admiration, \"you\\'ve made a hit with\\n', 'Chenney.  What the dickens did you talk about?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, coal,\" said Bones vaguely.\\n', '\\n', \"He wasn't quite certain what he had talked about, only he knew that in\\n\", 'his mind at dinner there had dawned a great idea.  Was Mr. Pyeburt a\\n', 'thought-reader?  Possibly he was.  Or possibly some chance word of his\\n', 'had planted the seed which was now germinating so favourably.\\n', '\\n', '\"Chenney is a man to know,\" he said.  \"He\\'s one of the most powerful\\n', 'fellows in the Cabinet.  Get right with him, and you can have a\\n', 'knighthood for the asking.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones blushed.\\n', '\\n', '\"A knighthood, dear old broker\\'s man?\" he said, with an elaborate\\n', 'shrug.  \"No use to me, my rare old athlete.  Lord Bones--Lord Tibbetts\\n', 'I mean--may sound beastly good, but what good is it, eh?

So he had started Lynhaven, and had built houses and\\n', 'villas and beautiful assembly rooms; and then, to complete the\\n', 'independence of Lynhaven, he had connected that town with the main\\n', 'traffic line by railway, which he built across eight miles of\\n', 'marshland.  By all the rules of the game, no man can create\\n', 'successfully in a spirit of vengeance, and Lynhaven should have been a\\n', 'failure.  It was, indeed, a great success, and repaid Mr. Chenney,\\n', 'Senior, handsomely.\\n', '\\n', 'But the railway, it seemed, was a failure, because the rival town had\\n', 'certain foreshore rights, and had employed those to lay a tramway from\\n', 'their hustling centre; and as the rival town was on the main line, the\\n', 'majority of visitors preferred going by the foreshore route in\\n', 'preference to the roundabout branch line route, which was somewhat\\n', 'handicapped by the fact that this, too, connected with the branch line\\n', 'at Tolness, a little town which had done great work in the War, but\\n', 'which did not attract the tourist in days of peace.\\n', '\\n', 'These were the facts about the Lynhaven line, not as they were set\\n', 'forth by Mr. Pyeburt--who took a much more optimistic view of the\\n', 'possibilities of the railway than did its detractors--but as they\\n', 'really were.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a fine line, beautifully laid and ballasted,\" said Mr. Pyeburt,\\n', 'shaking his head with melancholy admiration.  \"All that it wants behind\\n', \"it is a mind.  At present it's neglected; the freights and passenger\\n\", 'fares are too high, the rolling-stock wants replacing, but the\\n', 'locomotive stock is in most excellent condition.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Does he want to sell it?\" asked the interested Bones, and Mr. Pyeburt\\n', 'pursed his lips.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is extremely doubtful,\" he said carefully, \"but I think he might be\\n', 'approached.  If he does want to sell it, and you can take it off his\\n', 'hands----\"\\n', '\\n', 'He raised his own eyebrows with a significant gesture, which expressed\\n', \"in some subtle way that Bones's future was assured.\\n\", '\\n', 'Bones said he would think the matter over, and he did--aloud, in the\\n', 'presence of Hamilton.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a queer proposition,\" said Hamilton.  \"Of course, derelict\\n', 'railways can be made to pay.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should be general manager,\" said Bones more thoughtfully still.  \"My\\n', \"name would be printed on all the posters, of course.  And isn't there a\\n\", 'free pass over all the railways for railway managers?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I believe there is something of the sort,\" said Hamilton, \"but, on the\\n', 'whole, I think it would be cheaper to pay your fare than to buy a\\n', 'railway to get that privilege.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There is one locomotive,\" mused Bones.  \"It is called \\'Mary Louisa.\\'\\n', 'Pyeburt told me about it just as I was going away.  Of course, one\\n', 'would get a bit of a name and all that sort of thing.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He scratched his chin and walked thoughtfully into the office of Miss\\n', 'Marguerite Whitland.\\n', '\\n', 'She swung round in her chair and reached for her notebook, but Bones\\n', 'was not in a dictatorial mood.\\n', '\\n', '\"Young miss,\" he asked, \"how do you like Sir Augustus?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sir who?\" she demanded, puzzled.\\n', '\\n', '\"Sir Augustus,\" repeated Bones.\\n', '\\n', '\"I think it\\'s very funny,\" she said.\\n', '\\n', 'It was not the answer he expected, and instinctively she knew she had\\n', 'made a mistake.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, you\\'re thinking about yourself,\" she said quickly.  \"Are you going\\n', 'to be a knight, Mr. Tibbetts?

Never\\n', 'once had he been invited by the great and awe-inspiring men who\\n', 'dominate the finance of the City to participate in any of those\\n', 'adventurous undertakings which produce for the adventurers the fabulous\\n', 'profits about which so much has been written.  There were times when\\n', 'Bones even doubted whether the City knew he was in it.\\n', '\\n', 'He never realised his own insignificance so poignantly as when he\\n', 'strolled through the City streets at their busiest hour, and was\\n', 'unrecognised even by the bareheaded clerks who dashed madly in all\\n', 'directions, carrying papers of tremendous importance.\\n', '\\n', 'The indifference of the City to Mr. Tibbetts and his partner was more\\n', 'apparent than real.  It is true that the great men who sit around the\\n', 'green baize cloth at the Bank of England and arrange the bank rate knew\\n', 'not Bones nor his work.  It is equally true that the very important\\n', 'personages who occupy suites of rooms in Lombard Street had little or\\n', 'no idea of his existence.  But there were men, and rich and famous men\\n', 'at that, who had inscribed the name of Bones in indelible ink on the\\n', 'tablets of their memory.\\n', '\\n', 'The Pole Brothers were shipbrokers, and had little in common, in their\\n', 'daily transactions, with Mr. Harold de Vinne, who specialised in\\n', 'industrial stocks, and knew little more about ships than could be\\n', 'learnt in an annual holiday trip to Madeira.  Practically there was no\\n', 'bridge to connect their intellects.  Sentimentally, life held a common\\n', 'cause, which they discovered one day, when Mr. Fred Pole met Mr. Harold\\n', 'de Vinne at lunch to discuss a matter belonging neither to the realms\\n', 'of industrialism nor the mercantile marine, being, in fact, the\\n', \"question of Mr. de Vinne leasing or renting Mr. Pole's handsome\\n\", 'riverside property at Maidenhead for the term of six months.\\n', '\\n', 'They might not have met even under these circumstances, but for the\\n', 'fact that some dispute arose as to who was to pay the gardener.  That\\n', 'matter had been amicably settled, and the two had reached the coffee\\n', 'stage of their luncheon, when Mr. de Vinne mentioned the\\n', 'inadvisability--as a rule--of discussing business matters at lunch, and\\n', 'cited a deplorable happening when an interested eavesdropper had\\n', 'overheard certain important negotiations and had most unscrupulously\\n', 'taken advantage of his discovery.\\n', '\\n', '\"One of these days,\" said Mr. de Vinne between his teeth, \"I\\'ll be even\\n', 'with that gentleman.\"  (He did not call him a gentleman.)  \"I\\'ll give\\n', 'him Tibbetts!

Evidently Sanders was a big bug in West\\n', 'Africa.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On Friday they resumed their conversation, and Mr. de Vinne arrived\\n', 'with a plan.  It was a good plan.  He was tremulous with pride at the\\n', 'thought of it, and demanded applause and approval with every second\\n', 'breath, which was unlike him.\\n', '\\n', 'He was a man of many companies, good, bad, and indifferent, and,\\n', 'reviewing the enterprises with which his name was associated, he had,\\n', 'without the slightest difficulty, placed his finger upon the least\\n', 'profitable and certainly the most hopeless proposition in the Mazeppa\\n', \"Trading Company.  And nothing could be better for Mr. de Vinne's\\n\", 'purpose, not, as he explained to Fred Pole, if he had searched the\\n', 'Stock Exchange Year Book from cover to cover.\\n', '\\n', 'Once upon a time the Mazeppa Trading Company had been a profitable\\n', 'concern.  Its trading stores had dotted the African hinterland thickly.\\n', 'It had exported vast quantities of Manchester goods and Birmingham\\n', 'junk, and had received in exchange unlimited quantities of rubber and\\n', 'ivory.  But those were in the bad old days, before authority came and\\n', 'taught the aboriginal natives the exact value of a sixpenny\\n', 'looking-glass.\\n', '\\n', \"No longer was it possible to barter twenty pounds' worth of ivory for\\n\", 'threepennyworth of beads, and the flourishing Mazeppa Trading Company\\n', 'languished and died.  Its managers had grown immensely wealthy from\\n', 'their peculations and private trading, and had come home and were\\n', 'occupying opulent villas at Wimbledon, whilst the new men who had been\\n', 'sent to take their places had been so inexperienced that profits fell\\n', 'to nothing.  That, in brief, was the history of the Mazeppa Trading\\n', 'Company, which still maintained a few dilapidated stores, managed by\\n', 'half-castes and poor whites.\\n', '\\n', '\"I got most of the shares for a song,\" confessed Mr. de Vinne.  \"In\\n', 'fact, I happen to be one of the debenture-holders, and stepped in when\\n', \"things were going groggy.  We've been on the point of winding it up--it\\n\", 'is grossly over-capitalised--but I kept it going in the hope that\\n', 'something would turn up.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What is the general idea?\" asked Mr. Fred Pole, interested.\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'ll get a managing director,\" said Mr. de Vinne solemnly.  \"A man\\n', 'who is used to the handling of natives, a man acquainted with the West\\n', 'Coast of Africa, a man who can organise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Bones?\" suggested Mr. Fred.\\n', '\\n', '\"Bones be--jiggered!\" replied de Vinne scornfully.  \"Do you think he\\'d\\n', \"fall for that sort of thing?

Now,\\n\", 'my experience of a chap of that kind who retires is that he gets sick\\n', 'to death of doing nothing.  If we could only get at him and persuade\\n', 'him to accept the managing directorship, with six months a year on the\\n', 'Coast, at a salary of, say, two thousand a year, conditional on taking\\n', \"up six or seven thousand pounds' worth of shares, what do you think\\n\", 'would happen?\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Fred's imagination baulked at the problem, and he shook his head.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I\\'ll tell you what would happen,\" said Mr. de Vinne.  \"It happened\\n', 'once before, when another pal of Bones got let in on a motor car\\n', 'company.  Bones fell over himself to buy the shares and control the\\n', \"company.  And, mind you, the Mazeppa looks good.  It's the sort of\\n\", \"proposition that would appeal to a young and energetic man.  It's one\\n\", 'of those bogy companies that seem possible, and a fellow who knows the\\n', \"ropes would say straight away: 'If I had charge of that, I'd make it\\n\", 'pay.\\'  That\\'s what I\\'m banking on.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What are the shares worth?\" said Fred.\\n', '\\n', '\"About twopence net,\" replied the other brutally.  \"I\\'ll tell you\\n', \"frankly that I'd run this business myself if I thought there was any\\n\", 'chance of my succeeding.  But if Bones finds all the shares in one\\n', \"hand, he's going to shy.  What I'm prepared to do is this.  These\\n\", \"shares are worth twopence.  I'm going to sell you and a few friends\\n\", \"parcels at a shilling a share.  If nothing happens, I'll undertake to\\n\", 'buy them back at the same price.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A week later Hamilton brought news to the office of Tibbetts and\\n', 'Hamilton, Limited.\\n', '\\n', '\"The chief is going back to the Coast.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones opened his mouth wide in astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '\"Back to the Coast?\" he said incredulously.  \"You don\\'t mean he\\'s\\n', 'chucking jolly old Twickenham?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Hamilton nodded.\\n', '\\n', '\"He\\'s had an excellent offer from some people in the City to control a\\n', 'trading company.

You're thinking of Lady Godiva, but that doesn't\\n\", \"matter.  No, I don't suppose you've heard of the Mazeppa Company; it\\n\", 'did not operate in our territory.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bones shook his head and pursed his lips.\\n', '\\n', '\"But surely,\" he said, \"dear old Excellency hasn\\'t accepted a job\\n', 'without consulting me?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Hamilton made derisive noises.\\n', '\\n', '\"He fixed it up in a couple of days,\" he said, after a while.  \"It\\n', \"doesn't mean he'll be living on the Coast, but he'll probably be there\\n\", \"for some months in the year.  The salary is good--in fact, it's two\\n\", 'thousand a year.  I believe Sanders has to qualify for directorship by\\n', 'taking some shares, but the dear chap is enthusiastic about it, and so\\n', 'is Patricia.  It is all right, of course.  Sanders got the offer\\n', 'through a firm of solicitors.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Pooh!\" said Bones.  \"Solicitors are nobody.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He learnt more about the company that afternoon, for Sanders called in\\n', 'and gave a somewhat roseate view of the future.\\n', '\\n', '\"The fact is, Bones, I am getting stale,\" he said, \"and this looks like\\n', 'an excellent and a profitable occupation.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How did you get to hear about it, Excellency?\".  asked Bones.\\n', '\\n', 'His attitude was one of undisguised antagonism.  He might have been a\\n', 'little resentful that the opportunity had come to Sanders through any\\n', 'other agency than his own.\\n', '\\n', '\"I had a letter from the solicitors asking me if the idea appealed to\\n', 'me, and recalling my services on the Coast,\" said Sanders.  \"Of course\\n', 'I know very little about the Mazeppa Trading Company, though I had\\n', 'heard of it years gone past as a very profitable concern.

They pointed out the opportunities\\n', 'which existed--the possibilities of opening new stations--and I must\\n', 'confess that it appealed to me.  It will mean hard work, but the salary\\n', 'is good.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hold hard, Sir and Excellency,\" said Bones.  \"What did you have to put\\n', 'up in the way of shares?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Sanders flushed.  He was a shy man, and not given to talking about his\\n', 'money affairs.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, about five thousand pounds,\" he said awkwardly.  \"Of course, it\\'s\\n', \"a lot of money; but even if the business isn't successful, I have a\\n\", 'five-year contract with the company, and I get more than my investment\\n', 'back in salary.\"\\n', '\\n', 'That night Bones stayed on after Hamilton had left, and had for\\n', 'companion Miss Marguerite Whitland, a lady in whose judgment he had a\\n', 'most embarrassing faith.  He had given her plenty of work to do, and\\n', 'the rhythmical tap-tap of her typewriter came faintly through the door\\n', 'which separated the outer from the inner office.\\n', '\\n', 'Bones sat at his desk, his chin in his hand, a very thoughtful young\\n', 'man, and before him was a copy of the latest evening newspaper, opened\\n', 'at the Stock Exchange page.  There had been certain significant\\n', 'movements in industrial shares--a movement so interesting to the\\n', 'commentator upon Stock Exchange doings that he had inserted a paragraph\\n', 'to the effect that:\\n', '\\n', '\"The feature of the industrial market was the firmness of Mazeppa\\n', 'Trading shares, for which there was a steady demand, the stock closing\\n', 'at 19_s_. 9_d_.
