# - A brief (4-5 lines) description of what the program 
# read_excel_files.py is doing.

## Two functions but they do the same. Read Excel file, take
## 'Sheet1', turn columns into a list, choose single column,
## slice column to exclude first entry, extract values from 
## cell objects to list. Return list of values. 

# - Write down that function in around 4-5 lines of pseudocode

## Define function for reading Excel sheets.
## Does the same as described above but it takes two
## arguments: a filename and the index of the column of interest.
