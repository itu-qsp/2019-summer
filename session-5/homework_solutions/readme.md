# Remember that these are only suggestions for how to solve the assignments. There are many roads to Rome.

For Morten's video where he goes through these assignments go to https://use.vg/ntStrH9TfUHJ 

Morten's code is in the capital letter .py files and Helge's are in the lower case .py files. 

Morten goes looks up the doc-string for .setdefault() on google. If you want to do that without internet access you could use
 
```python
my_dictionary = {}
print(help(my_dictionary.setdefault)) 
```

Remember that when you use help on a method you shouldn't use the () after the method name.
