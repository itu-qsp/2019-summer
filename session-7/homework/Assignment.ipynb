    "# Assignment 7: Working with Excel and tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to generate some statistics about Copenhagen's citizens. On the way you will repeat/learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How to read Excel files.\n",
    "  * Create functions in Python.\n",
    "  * Use `for` loops to iterate over elements of a list.\n",
    "  * Lookup elements in dictionaries.\n",
    "  * Use `set`s in Python together with some of their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two datasets. Both are found in this folder with the homework assignment.  \n",
    "One is `befkbhalderstatkode_small.xlsx`, which contains statistics about Copenhagen's population corresponding to the year 2015. This dataset was created from the data available at [http://data.kk.dk/dataset/befolkningen-efter-ar-bydel-alder-og-statsborgerskab](http://data.kk.dk/dataset/befolkningen-efter-ar-bydel-alder-og-statsborgerskab), where you can also find a more in depth description of the given data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset, `country_codes.xlsx`, comes originally from Danmarks Statistik and maps country codes to countries of origin, see [http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/Times/forebyggelsesregistret/statkode.aspx](http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/Times/forebyggelsesregistret/statkode.aspx).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise A: Reading Excel Files\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Inspect the code in the file `read_excel_files.py`. \n",
    "  * It contains two functions `country_codes_in_kbh_data` and `country_codes_in_stats_data`, which reads one Excel file each ( `befkbhalderstatkode_small.xlsx` and `country_codes.xlsx` respectively.)\n",
    " The two functions are almost the same. Compare them line by line. Can you spot the difference?\n",
    "  * Open both `.xlsx` files with one of the programs _Excel_, _OpenOffice_, _GoogleSpreadheets_, etc. to inspect their contents.\n",
    "  * Set a breakpoint on line `5` in `read_excel_files.py` and use the debugger to step through the execution of this program.\n",
    "  * Try to understand what is going on by observing the values of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand-in:\n",
    "  * A brief (4-5 lines) description of what the program `read_excel_files.py` is doing.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is quite unpractical and redundant to use both the two functions `country_codes_in_kbh_data` and `country_codes_in_stats_data` when they do almost the same thing. It would be much better to have one function that would read both files! \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Write down that function in around 4-5 lines of pseudocode\n",
    "    \n",
    "Hand-in your description and pseudo-code in a file `A.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise B: Creating a New Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `country_codes_data` in `country_codes_stats.py`, to unify the two functions `country_codes_in_kbh_data` and `country_codes_in_stats_data` into one. The function should capture variability via two arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the function definition will look something like the following, see file `country_codes_stats.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def country_codes_data(filename, column_number):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Read country code data from a given Excel file,\n",
    "    in which entire columns contain country codes and\n",
    "    the first row is a header row without values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    :param filename: str\n",
    "        Path to the Excel (.xslx) file containing a row\n",
    "        with country codes\n",
    "    :param column_number: int\n",
    "        The index number of the column containing the\n",
    "        country codes.\n",
    "    :return: list\n",
    "        A list of country code numbers.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # TODO: Implement me!\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand-in `country_codes_stats.py` completed with your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise C: Filtering for Unique Elements and Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the list of `country_codes`, which is returned from `befkbhalderstatkode_small.xlsx` contains many duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Modify the function `country_codes_data(filename, column_number)` from the earlier `country_codes_stats.py` so that it returns a list of **unique** country codes. That is, it does not contain duplicates!\n",
    "    - _Hint:_ remember a basic Python data structure, which can hold collections of elements, where each element is unique.\n",
    "  * Modify the function `country_codes_data(filename, column_number)` even further, so that it returns a sorted list of unique country codes.\n",
    "    - _Hint:_ use the function `sorted` to return a sorted list.\n",
    "    - _Hint:_ In case you are in doubt, use Mu to read the documentation of the `sorted` function by typing `sorted(` and read the text that appears or `print(help(sorted))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand-in your solution as `C.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise D: A Test Case for Checking your Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To check that your implementation (or parts of it) works correctly, run the test case `test_country_codes_stats.py` against your `country_codes_stats.py` module. You can do so by running it with `pytest` from the command-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pytest test_country_codes_stats.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should first of all make sure that all the tests pass. If they do not there is something wrong with your code!\n",
    "* Second, try to come up with a test case and add it to the bottom of the file. Do not forget to run it to see if it passes!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand-in your extended implementation of `test_country_codes_stats.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise E (OPTIONAL): Dictionary Lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `translate_code_to_text` in your `country_codes_stats.py` module. The goal is to allow you to translate a numerical country code into an explanatory string. For example, the following code should print `'Belgien'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "descriptive_string = translate_code_to_text(5126)\n",
    "print(descriptive_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - _Hint:_ Obviously, your function gets a single argument for the country code.\n",
    "  - _Hint:_ Make use of the module `stats_code.py`, which contains a variable with a dictionary `COUNTRY_CODES`. That is, after importing the module, you can lookup the description of a country code via something like the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "belgien_code = stat_codes.COUNTRY_CODES['5126']\n",
    "print(belgien_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  which should print `'Belgien'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand-in a file called `E.py` in which the function `translate_code_to_text` is implemented."
