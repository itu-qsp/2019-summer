# Exercise C: Counting words (1/4)
# Imagine you were to write a function called count_word_in_text that counts 
# the occurrence of a single word from some text. Write down a few bullet points
# about how you would break this down into smaller problems. Think about this:

# What is the input?
## Some sort of string with words

# What is the expected output?
## I want it to give me an integer

# What things might you need to save in variables as the program runs?
## I need the string, I need to keep track of how many times I've seen the word
