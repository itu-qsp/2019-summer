Assignment A:

1. The value of that element is 0, since it's at position 0, 
which is the first item that the if statement checks for equality.

2. If the value of element is outside of this range (it returns None).
It is because we look at all values without returning in the for loop. 
We do 10000 comparisons.

3. The answer is b, linear runtime.See above.
