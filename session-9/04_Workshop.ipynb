    "1. Make sure that you understand\n",
    "  - Algorithmic complexity and Big-O notation\n",
    "  - Abstract data types\n",
    "    - Stacks and Queues\n",
    "2. Implement the remainder of your `Stack` implementation\n",
    "  - `pop`, `is_empty`, `size`\n",

    "  * Try to understand what is going wrong. If in doubt run the program in the debugger and _click_ through it to understand what is going on.\n",
