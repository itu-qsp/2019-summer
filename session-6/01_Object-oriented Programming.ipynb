The `__init__()` method creates an instance representing this particular book and sets the `author` and `title` attributes using the values we provided. The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance representing this book. We store that instance in the variable `empty_book`.

    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s model a comic book. A comic book is just a specific kind of book, with less text and more images :). Consequently, we can base our new `ComicBook` class on the `Book` class we wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write code for the attributes and behavior specific to comic books.\n",

    "When you create a child class, the parent class **must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file**.

It tells Python to call the `__init__()` method from `ComicBook`’s parent class, which gives a `ComicBook` instance all the attributes of its parent class. The name super comes from a convention of calling the parent class a **superclass** and the child class a **subclass**."
