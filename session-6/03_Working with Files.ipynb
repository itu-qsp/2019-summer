    "Let’s start by looking at the `open() function`. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The `open()` function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that is currently being executed is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function returns an object representing the file. Here, `open(file_name)` returns an object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`. Python stores this object in `file_object`, which we will work with later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `with` denotes a *Context Manager*, which essentially wraps a block of code and performs an action at the end of the block, no matter how it exits. In this case, it closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call `open()` in this program but not `close()`. You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` statement from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It is not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the time is right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a file object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`, we use the `read()` method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the **entire** text file back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because `read()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use `rstrip()`."
